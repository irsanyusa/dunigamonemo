The storyline of the drama series revolves around the life of a lesbian couple Stef and Lena, who are a cop and school vice principal respectively.</p><p class=align-left>Stef and Lena are exemplary parents trying to raise one of their biological child and four other adopted children in San Diego, California. When the first season of this drama series hit the televisions, both fans and critics gave favourable reviews primarily due to its portrayal of the LGBT themes. In The Fosters, Jake portrayed Jesus Adams Foster. Jesus is the son of Stef and Lena, sibling to Jude, Brandon, and Callie, and the twin brother of Mariana. Marian and Jesus share a lot of hatred towards their biological mother.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/9afeb30bd7809772.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jake DeVito biography: who is one of Danny Devito’s children?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Adams has ADHD and is a member of the wrestling team.
