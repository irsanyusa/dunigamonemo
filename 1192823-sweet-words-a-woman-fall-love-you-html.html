Words can’t describe how much I love you.</li><li>I was about to say something… but I looked at you and forgot what I wanted to say.</li><li>If there was a choice between loving you and breathing, my last breath would be used just to say that I love you.</li><li>Do you know why I believe in God? Because He gave me the greatest miracle – He brought me you.</li><li>Whenever my phone rings and I see your name on the screen, my heart instantly beats faster. What have you done to me, girl?</li><li>If there’s anything called freedom from love, I would rather be in chains than wander aimlessly deprived of your love.</li><li>People say that a picture can tell you a thousand words. For me, a picture of you can tell only three of the most important words: I love you!</li><li>I adore all these little things you do when you show your care for me. They only make me love and appreciate you more. Thank you for being here.</li><li>The day I met you, I found the piece of me I didn’t know was missing. I fancy you, this relationship and the better part of me you brought out.</li><li>The moment I first kissed you, I gave you everything.

Below are sweet romantic words for her to accompany the sweet romantic things you do for her to make her love you even more.</p><ul><li>You were my wish upon a shooting star. I remember wishing to find true love one day, and I did. Now, I believe that every wish always comes true if you really need it.</li><li>My love, you deserve the entire world. I am unable to give you the world, but I can give you something even more valuable: I can give you my heart, my soul, and all of me.</li><li>You are my everything, my flower. Do you notice how hard and long I stare at you, how stuck I get when I catch a whiff of your fragrance? Do you even know that you are my everything, the only flower in my entire garden?</li><li>From the top of your head to the tips of your toes, I adore everything and everywhere in between.</li><li>I will always make you feel like you are the most special and beautiful woman in the entire world. This is my main objective – to make you smile and feel good about yourself.</li><li>When it is a beautiful cloudless night, and you, by any chance, are outside, just look at the sky. You will see thousands of stars. Every one of them stands for one reason why I cherish you so much.</li><li>I have never seen someone as graceful and elegant as you are. When I look at you, I understand what true love feels like. You give me goosebumps every time you smile. The day I met you was the happiest day of my life.</li><li>I need you like the poet needs the pain and like the flowers need the rain. Living is wonderful, but living without you is hurtful. I am entirely yours – my body and soul fully belong to you.</li><li>Even if I try, I won’t be able to express the way I feel about you. Every day when I wake up (even on Mondays!) I feel so overwhelmed with happiness; I almost lose my breath.</li><li>I adore the way you always wrap your arms around my neck. In your passionate embrace, I feel like I am protected from all troubles and worries.</li><li>I love all the parts of your body and all the traits of your personality. There is not one part of you that I do not love.</li><li>You are the reason why I breathe. If you left, it would feel like my breathing was cut off.</li><li>If I was asked what love means to me, I would not even hesitate – I would reply in just one word. For me, love is you.</li><li>Seeing you with someone else is impossible. For me, you are only mine, and you will always be mine deep in my heart.</li><li>It would take so long to list all the reasons why I love you. But the main reason is that you are a beautiful and charming person, and I am just magically drawn to you.</li><li>Being with you makes life so easy for me, and it is incredible how your presence can change so much about me.</li><li>Honey, do you know that after we meet, it is impossible to forget your fragrance, your touch and your smile for weeks?</li><li>My love for you will never end, and I mean these words. It is eternal and unstoppable, and if it ever changes, it will only change for the better.</li><li>In case your love is a dream, then I never want to wake up from it, otherwise, my entire life will be a nightmare.</li><li>English vocabulary does not have enough words for describing how you make me feel. This special feeling I feel when I am next to you is the best thing ever.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/05fb3ff22bcef841.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20+ apology letters to girlfriend for when you really messed up</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/9642b0e131c54f3a.png><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> <a href=#>100+ romantic love messages for husband to make him feel loved</a></p><h3 id=1192823-sweet-things-to-say-to-your-girlfriend-when-she39s-mad class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Sweet things to say to your girlfriend when she's mad</h3><p class=align-left>Little fights in a relationship are normal.
