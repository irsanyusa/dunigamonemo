But the story of the painting, which plays a much smaller role in the real history of Sitting Bull and Weldon than it does in the movie, is actually a window into a pivotal moment in American history.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Here’s what to know about the real people and historical events that inspired the movie.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Who Was Sitting Bull?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">One of history’s most famous Native American leaders, he’s most well known today for defeating General George Custer’s army at <a href=# rel=noopener>The Battle of the Little Bighorn</a> on June 25, 1876, near the Little Bighorn River in what was then Montana Territory. The confrontation was sparked by Custer’s troops discovering gold in the Sioux-controlled Black Hills, now in South Dakota, in 1874. The Sioux emerged victorious, and about <a href=# rel=noopener>260 U.S. soldiers</a> are thought to have died in what’s sometimes called Custer’s Last Stand.<strong><br></strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sitting Bull became famous after the battle through his role in Buffalo Bill Cody’s variety show <a href=# rel=noopener>Buffalo Bill’s Wild West.</a> Though such shows were founded on the exploitation of stereotypical ideas, they were also a chance for Native Americans to make money and meet people who may be sympathetic to their cause, <a href=# rel=noopener>according to</a> the National Museum of the American Indian.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Who Was Catherine Weldon?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">She had several different identities. As explained by the book that inspired the movie, Eileen Pollack’s <i>Woman Walking Ahead</i>:<i> In Search of Catherine Weldon and Sitting Bull, </i>she was born Susanna Faesch in Switzerland in 1844 and immigrated to Brooklyn, N.Y. when she was a child. She made her living selling her embroidery. (She was not a widow, as the movie suggests.) She first married a Swiss doctor, Claude Schlatter, but that marriage didn’t last. They got a divorce, and she ran off with a lover and got pregnant with her son, Christopher. When she moved out West, she changed her surname to Weldon, thought to be an attempt to cover up the divorce and the fact that she had a son out of wedlock.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Though her personal life could be chaotic, she found her purpose in advocating for Native American rights as a member of the National Indian Defense Association.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Why Did She Visit Sitting Bull?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">What exactly prompted Weldon to travel to see Sitting Bull is unknown, but her biography provides several clues. Native American culture was a subject of fascination in Switzerland during the time of her youth, and Pollack says that after she came to the U.S. she might have been inspired to action by the newspaper coverage of the Indians losing their land during westward expansion.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Dawes Act of 1887 confined the Sioux to smaller reservations, and the reduced land led to food scarcity and rationing. The buffalo were <a href=# rel=noopener>gone</a>. The policy was “the white man’s effort to remake Indians as white men in all but color,” says Robert M. Utley, author of Sitting Bull: The Life and Times of an American Patriot and former National Park Service historian. By forcing Native Americans to live on designated farm plots, Utley explains, Washington moved toward the dual dubious goals of “civilizing” Indians and also opening up what had been their land to white settlement.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sitting Bull traveled to Washington, D.C., for negotiations about fair prices for the land in October 1888, and Weldon began corresponding with him shortly after. According to Pollack, their letters — which don’t survive today but were mentioned in other Weldon papers — contained details of these talks, fair prices for Dakota land and maps of the government’s plans to reduce the size of the tribes’ reservations.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Pollack tells TIME that Weldon, 52 years old at this point, went to Standing Rock (in June 1889 and again in May 1890) first and foremost to be Sitting Bull’s “advocate and translator.” The scene in the movie in which Weldon, who was not very wealthy, gives her money and possessions to feed the hungry people is fairly accurate. The people she helped rewarded her with a name: “Woman Walking Ahead.” But the <a href=# rel=noopener>four portraits</a> of Sitting Bull she painted during that time were not the main reason she went out there, contrary to the impression some might get from watching the film.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“[To Sitting Bull], that differentiated her from other whites — her generosity,” Pollack says. “She didn’t save anybody but she helped.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Were Sitting Bull and Catherine Weldon Romantically Involved?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It’s an understandable question watching the Sitting Bull character de-robe in front of Weldon in a tent in the film.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“There was some romantic tension,” Pollack says. “There’s evidence that he proposed marriage.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But, Pollack says, the record shows that Weldon wasn’t interested in marrying Sitting Bull (who had two wives) and maintained their relationship as his friend, lobbyist and helper.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">What Was the Ghost Dance?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Though it plays a relatively minor role in the movie — Weldon and Sitting Bull emerge from the tent and see tribe members dancing in a circle around a fire pit, looking up at the sky with their arms outstretched in the air — the Ghost Dance is an important part of the Sitting Bull story. The Ghost Dance was a religious movement that emerged in some Native American communities amid the upheaval in the late 1800s. The practice involved participants donning outfits thought to give them power against bullets and dancing, as historian Mark Hirsch wrote for<a href=# rel=noopener> American Indian</a> magazine, to “hasten the coming of the new world” — a world that was like the way things were before white settlers came. “Lakotas were ready for a message of hope,” Hirsch explained.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Woman Walks Ahead Director Susanna White consulted Native American choreographers and elders to make sure the “ghost dance” was as accurate as possible, and worked off music that had been passed down through generation.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sitting Bull actually had mixed feelings about the ritual; Utley says that he was skeptical about its ideas but willing to go along on the idea that participants might be onto something. Weldon, on the other hand, worried about how the U.S. government would perceive the movement. And she was right; the white officials watching the Native Americans dancing were scared by it and responded with extreme force.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“His resistance to being removed from the reservation for his part in the Ghost Dance led to the attempt to arrest him,” says Utley, “which in turn led to his death.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sitting Bull was shot to death by police on Dec. 15, 1890.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Is This the Same Standing Rock?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Yes. The place where Weldon visits Sitting Bull is the same place that made news recently as the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and their allies gathered there to oppose the construction of the <a href=#>Dakota access pipeline</a> for fears that it would contaminate their water supply.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“The Dawes Act ultimately deprived the Sioux of much of their treaty-guaranteed land and confined them to small separate reservations,” Utley writes. “[Sitting Bull] would have applauded their opposition to the Dakota Pipeline. The white man worked at their destruction because of hunger for Indian land and an idealistic concept that Indians should be transformed into imitation white men. The contest lasted for half a century and continues in muted form to this day.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Correction: July 3</strong><br>The original version of this article misstated details about Catherine Weldon’s early life. She was born in 1844, not 1838. She immigrated to the U.S. when she was a child, not when she was 33. She did not marry and have a son with Richard Weldon. The name Weldon was part of an identity she made up when she moved out West, and she had a son with an unknown man she did not marry.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZua2JqhHKCjrCmppmeYsSiuMqsZJqglZaxbsDRrpxmq6Skv7p5xZqarWWWnrC1tc6nZg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwoman-walks-ahead-true-story-fact-fiction.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwoman-walks-ahead-true-story-fact-fiction.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwoman-walks-ahead-true-story-fact-fiction.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwoman-walks-ahead-true-story-fact-fiction.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwoman-walks-ahead-true-story-fact-fiction.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwoman-walks-ahead-true-story-fact-fiction.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./13-stunning-hybrid-animals-that-actually-exist-638960.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./13-stunning-hybrid-animals-that-actually-exist-638960.html>13 Stunning Hybrid Animals That Actually Exist</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./university-of-stirling.html>University of Stirling | Scotland.org</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./university-of-stirling.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
