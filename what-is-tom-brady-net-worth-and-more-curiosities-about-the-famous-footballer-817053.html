The famous quarterback of&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>New England Patriots</a> has an&nbsp;impressive list of&nbsp;achievements over the years of&nbsp;his <a href=# title=career data-link=tag>career</a>. One of&nbsp;the most well-known is&nbsp;his <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>record</a> of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>seven</a> Super Bowl MVP awards, and he&nbsp;was named the game’s Most Valuable Player (MVP) five times.</p><p>However, there are way more things to&nbsp;remember him about. Over the years of&nbsp;his successful career, it’s right to&nbsp;ask, “What is&nbsp;Tom Brady net worth?” And we&nbsp;will happily tell you about that!</p><p><h2>His passion for sport started at&nbsp;a&nbsp;very young age.</h2></p><p>On&nbsp;August&nbsp;3, 1977, in&nbsp;the city of&nbsp;San Mateo, <a href=# title=California data-link=tag>California</a>, the sporting legend Thomas Edward Patrick Brady&nbsp;Jr. entered the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>world</a>. <strong>Even during his </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>formative years</strong></a><strong> at&nbsp;Junipero Serra High School, Brady showcased exceptional prowess in&nbsp;both football and baseball, laying the foundation for a&nbsp;stellar athletic career.</strong></p><p>In&nbsp;1995, after completing his high school journey, Brady faced a&nbsp;pivotal choice. Despite the opportunity to&nbsp;pursue a&nbsp;career in&nbsp;professional baseball, he&nbsp;opted for a&nbsp;different path, choosing to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>attend</a> the University of&nbsp;Michigan. This decision marked the beginning of&nbsp;a&nbsp;transformative chapter in&nbsp;his life.</p><p><strong>Upon joining the university’s football team, Brady found himself initially spending limited time on&nbsp;the field during his first two college seasons.</strong> However, his persistence and dedication paved the way for a&nbsp;breakthrough in&nbsp;his junior year, when he&nbsp;assumed the pivotal role of&nbsp;the starting quarterback. This season proved to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;turning point, with Brady <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>displaying</a> his talent by&nbsp;<strong>throwing an&nbsp;impressive 350 passes for a&nbsp;total of&nbsp;2,636&nbsp;yards.</strong></p><p>The culmination of&nbsp;his college football journey unfolded in&nbsp;his final season, where Brady played a&nbsp;pivotal role in&nbsp;steering his team to&nbsp;a&nbsp;triumphant victory in&nbsp;the Orange Bowl. This achievement not only highlighted his individual skills but also showcased his leadership and contribution to&nbsp;the collective success of&nbsp;the team.</p><p>The University of&nbsp;Michigan served as&nbsp;the crucible where Brady’s athletic talents were honed and polished. The choices he&nbsp;made during this critical period laid the groundwork for the illustrious career that would follow, eventually propelling him to&nbsp;become one of&nbsp;the greatest quarterbacks in&nbsp;the history of&nbsp;the National Football League (NFL).</p><p>During his tenure as&nbsp;the starting <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>quarterback</a> at&nbsp;the University of&nbsp;Michigan, Thomas Edward Patrick Brady&nbsp;Jr. achieved commendable success. Over the span of&nbsp;two seasons, Brady contributed to&nbsp;an<strong>&nbsp;impressive 20–5&nbsp;record, marking victories at&nbsp;prominent events like the 1999 Citrus Bowl and the 2000 Orange Bowl. </strong>These triumphs underscored his instrumental role in&nbsp;the team’s accomplishments during his college football journey.</p><p>Brady’s individual statistics at&nbsp;Michigan further solidified his standing as&nbsp;a&nbsp;formidable player. His career concluded with notable rankings in&nbsp;the university’s football history—<strong>third in&nbsp;attempts and completions with 710 and 442&nbsp;respectively, fourth in&nbsp;total yards with 5,351, and a&nbsp;fifth-place standing in&nbsp;touchdown passes with 35.</strong> These accomplishments showcased Brady’s skill, precision, and impactful contributions to&nbsp;the team’s overall performance.</p><p>In&nbsp;December 1999, Brady achieved another significant milestone by&nbsp;<strong>graduating from the University of&nbsp;Michigan with a&nbsp;Bachelor of&nbsp;Arts in&nbsp;General Studies. </strong>This academic achievement added another layer to&nbsp;his multifaceted journey, highlighting his commitment to&nbsp;both his education and his burgeoning football career.</p><p><h2>After the college success, he&nbsp;was all ready to&nbsp;start his professional career.</h2></p><p>When Tom Brady transitioned from <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>college</a> to&nbsp;the NFL, he&nbsp;wasn’t met with much fanfare. His unremarkable performance at&nbsp;the NFL Scouting Combine only reinforced the skepticism surrounding his potential as&nbsp;a&nbsp;professional football player. <strong>Consequently, Brady had to&nbsp;patiently wait until the sixth round of&nbsp;the 2000&nbsp;NFL Draft to&nbsp;hear his name called.</strong> The New England Patriots took a&nbsp;chance on&nbsp;him as&nbsp;the 199th overall pick, making him the seventh quarterback selected.</p><p>What happened next would redefine the narrative around Brady’s capabilities. The 2001 season marked a&nbsp;turning point in&nbsp;his career. When the starting quarterback, Drew Bledsoe, suffered an&nbsp;injury, Brady seized the opportunity and showcased his leadership qualities and powerful arm. Under his guidance, the team achieved an&nbsp;<strong>impressive record of&nbsp;11&nbsp;wins and 3&nbsp;losses in&nbsp;the 14&nbsp;games he&nbsp;started.</strong> The postseason further solidified Brady’s impact, culminating in&nbsp;a&nbsp;remarkable victory over the St. Louis Rams at&nbsp;Super Bowl XXXVI, where he&nbsp;earned the game’s MVP award.</p><p>Brady’s success didn’t end there. Two years later, he&nbsp;led the Patriots to&nbsp;triumph at&nbsp;Super Bowl XXXVIII against the Carolina Panthers, securing his second Super Bowl MVP award. The 2004 season witnessed yet another Super Bowl victory for Brady and the Patriots, <strong>this time defeating the Philadelphia Eagles with a&nbsp;score of&nbsp;24-21</strong>.</p><p>In&nbsp;recognition of&nbsp;his contributions, Brady inked a&nbsp;new six-year contract with the Patriots in&nbsp;2005. The 2006 season unfolded with the team boasting a&nbsp;commendable 12-4 record in&nbsp;the regular season, a&nbsp;testament to&nbsp;Brady’s enduring prowess as&nbsp;a&nbsp;quarterback. This era marked the beginning of&nbsp;a&nbsp;remarkable journey that would see <strong>Brady’s name etched in&nbsp;NFL history as&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the greatest quarterbacks of&nbsp;all time.</strong></p><p><h2>At&nbsp;one point, he&nbsp;was nearly impossible to&nbsp;defeat!</h2></p><p>In&nbsp;2007, the New England Patriots, boasting the talents of&nbsp;star wide <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>receiver</a> Randy Moss, orchestrated one of&nbsp;the most formidable offenses in&nbsp;the history of&nbsp;the NFL. Tom Brady, their quarterback maestro, <strong>achieved a&nbsp;milestone by&nbsp;throwing a&nbsp;then-record 50&nbsp;touchdown passes, securing his inaugural MVP award.</strong> The Patriots dominated the regular season, leaving an&nbsp;indelible mark with an&nbsp;undefeated record. However, the climax of&nbsp;their journey took an&nbsp;unexpected turn as&nbsp;they faced a&nbsp;heart-wrenching defeat against the New York Giants in&nbsp;Super Bowl XLII.</p><p>Brady’s legacy extends far beyond that season. Recognized as&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>winningest quarterback</a> in&nbsp;NFL history, he&nbsp;amassed a&nbsp;staggering 286 victories—251 in&nbsp;the regular season and 35&nbsp;in&nbsp;the postseason. <strong>His winning percentage of .754 stands as&nbsp;the highest among quarterbacks who have started 100&nbsp;games</strong>, showcasing his exceptional prowess on&nbsp;the field.</p><p>Moreover, Brady holds the unique distinction of&nbsp;being <strong>the only </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>quarterback</strong></a><strong> in&nbsp;NFL history to&nbsp;secure 200 regular season victories</strong>, accompanied by&nbsp;an&nbsp;unprecedented 35&nbsp;postseason triumphs—more than twice the victories of&nbsp;any other quarterback. His remarkable feat of&nbsp;winning all 16&nbsp;regular season games in&nbsp;2007 further solidifies his unparalleled achievements.</p><p>Spanning 21&nbsp;seasons as&nbsp;the primary starter, Brady achieved an&nbsp;unprecedented seven Super Bowl titles, surpassing all other players and even outpacing any NFL franchise. <strong>His appearance in&nbsp;a&nbsp;record 10&nbsp;Super Bowls</strong>, representing nearly half the seasons in&nbsp;which he&nbsp;was the primary starter, stands as&nbsp;a&nbsp;testament to&nbsp;his enduring excellence, exceeding the accomplishments of&nbsp;any NFL franchise outside the Patriots.</p><p>Furthermore, Brady’s exceptional career is&nbsp;highlighted by&nbsp;his distinction as&nbsp;the only player to&nbsp;earn Super Bowl MVP honors with two different franchises—New England and Tampa Bay. This unique achievement adds another layer to&nbsp;his storied career, emphasizing his impact across different teams and eras in&nbsp;the NFL.</p><p><h2>After a&nbsp;long success string, Brady decided to&nbsp;retire.</h2></p><p><strong>On&nbsp;February&nbsp;1, 2023, Tom Brady took to&nbsp;social media to&nbsp;share a&nbsp;significant </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>announcement</strong></a><strong>—he was retiring from professional football, declaring it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;a&nbsp;permanent departure.</strong> Nine days later, he&nbsp;formalized this decision by&nbsp;filing <a href=# title=retirement data-link=tag>retirement</a> papers with both the NFL and NFLPA. This strategic timing ensures that Brady becomes eligible for induction into the prestigious Pro Football Hall of&nbsp;Fame starting in&nbsp;2028.</p><p>The impact of&nbsp;Brady’s retirement rippled through the football community, prompting reflections on&nbsp;his legendary career and countless achievements. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;quarterback, he&nbsp;reshaped the narrative of&nbsp;success and left an&nbsp;indelible mark on&nbsp;the sport.</p><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;heartwarming turn of&nbsp;events, Patriots owner <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Robert Kraft</a>, on&nbsp;May&nbsp;11, 2023, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a> the news on&nbsp;NFL Network’s Good Morning Football. The New England Patriots, the team with which Brady achieved unparalleled success, would <strong>officially honor him with a&nbsp;homecoming appearance during the opening game of&nbsp;the 2023&nbsp;season.</strong> This special occasion would be&nbsp;accentuated by&nbsp;a&nbsp;halftime ceremony, underscoring Brady’s immense contributions to&nbsp;the franchise and commemorating his legacy in&nbsp;the hearts of&nbsp;Patriots fans. “It&nbsp;will be&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;many celebrations to&nbsp;honor [Brady] and say thank you for what he&nbsp;did for&nbsp;us in&nbsp;20&nbsp;years playing for the [Patriots],” shared Kraft.</p><p>The planned homecoming celebration not only symbolizes gratitude and admiration for Brady’s extraordinary career but also serves as&nbsp;a&nbsp;fitting tribute to&nbsp;the quarterback who played a&nbsp;pivotal role in&nbsp;bringing multiple Super Bowl victories to&nbsp;the New England Patriots. As&nbsp;fans eagerly anticipate this momentous event, it&nbsp;stands as&nbsp;a&nbsp;testament to&nbsp;Brady’s enduring impact and the lasting <a href=# title=bond data-link=tag>bond</a> between the legendary quarterback and the team that became synonymous with his illustrious career.</p><p><h2>His personal life is&nbsp;also full of&nbsp;events, just like his career.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3d1/ed8/11abed5db6843175b216e09929.jpg><p>ASSOCIATED PRESS/East News</p><p>In&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;his stellar football career, Tom Brady has found himself in&nbsp;the limelight for reasons beyond the gridiron.

His diet excludes various food items, including fruits, mushrooms, tomatoes, peppers, eggplants, coffee, Gatorade, white sugar, flour, gluten, dairy, soda, cereal, white rice, potatoes, and bread.</p><p>In&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;dietary choices, Brady’s health routine encompasses a&nbsp;holistic approach. This <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>includes</a> practices such as&nbsp;<strong>transcendental meditation and <a href=# title=yoga data-link=tag>yoga</a> to&nbsp;foster mental well-being, along with a&nbsp;consistent hydration regimen.</strong> The 80/20 diet principle, which emphasizes an&nbsp;80% alkaline and&nbsp;20% acidic balance, is&nbsp;another aspect of&nbsp;his wellness routine. Beyond diet, he&nbsp;prioritizes an&nbsp;early bedtime, engages in&nbsp;resistance training to&nbsp;maintain physical strength, and participates in&nbsp;neuroplasticity training to&nbsp;enhance cognitive abilities.</p><p>The amalgamation of&nbsp;these practices forms the comprehensive TB12&nbsp;Method, reflecting Brady’s commitment to&nbsp;a&nbsp;holistic lifestyle that goes beyond the football field.
