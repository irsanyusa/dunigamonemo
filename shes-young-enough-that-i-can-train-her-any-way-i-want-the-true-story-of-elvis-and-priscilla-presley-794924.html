The girl’s parents were worried about their relationship, but Priscilla was in&nbsp;<a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a> and rebellious, and nothing and no&nbsp;one could keep her from being with <a href=# title="the King" data-link=tag>the King</a> of&nbsp;Rock and Roll. For Elvis, their age difference was not a&nbsp;problem at&nbsp;all: it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;good chance for him to&nbsp;mold Priscilla into an&nbsp;ideal wife. This was going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;perfect <a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a>, but there was something their relationship couldn’t survive.</p><p>Here at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> we&nbsp;took a&nbsp;peek behind the curtain of&nbsp;Elvis and Priscilla’s relationship, and here’s how the story played out.</p><p><h2>The beginning</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/20d/787/01a69f568ba24e7d094160193e.jpg><p>Elvis and Priscilla <a href=#>met</a> in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Germany data-link=tag>Germany</a> in&nbsp;1959. Elvis was sent there by&nbsp;the U.S. Army where he&nbsp;then served, and Priscilla’s family came to&nbsp;the country because her father was transferred there by&nbsp;the Air Force. Someone invited Priscilla to&nbsp;visit Elvis at&nbsp;his home, and she happily agreed. She captured the singer’s attention, and he&nbsp;played a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;songs especially for her, even though she confessed she was a&nbsp;9th grader.</p><p>“I&nbsp;saw Elvis trying to&nbsp;get my&nbsp;attention. I&nbsp;noticed that the less response I&nbsp;showed, the more he&nbsp;began singing just for&nbsp;me. I&nbsp;couldn’t believe that Elvis Presley was trying to&nbsp;impress&nbsp;me,” <a href=#>recollects</a> Priscilla.</p><p>Priscilla did not <a href=#>believe</a> that Elvis was ever going to&nbsp;call her back and she was sure that their first date was going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;their last one. But he&nbsp;did call her back. After a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;days Priscilla’s parents insisted that meeting their daughter’s crush in&nbsp;person was necessary. Priscilla <a href=#>recollects</a> that Elvis came all dressed up&nbsp;in&nbsp;his uniform, which her father loved. The men had a&nbsp;long talk, and eventually, Priscilla’s parents were so&nbsp;charmed by&nbsp;Elvis that they let the 2&nbsp;continue to&nbsp;see each other.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/229/e83/c8d031533eba6f6310964c96f0.jpg><p>Priscilla was a&nbsp;very beautiful young girl who received a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;looks from the boys at&nbsp;school. She <a href=#>remembers</a> that, once, a&nbsp;picture of&nbsp;her wearing tight sweater was stolen from the bulletin board at&nbsp;school. Priscilla’s young age meant that she and Elvis were not supposed to&nbsp;show up&nbsp;in&nbsp;public together, but the 2&nbsp;kept seeing each other.</p><p>Elvis liked it&nbsp;that Priscilla was inexperienced and young, and their age gap was not a&nbsp;problem for him. He&nbsp;saw it&nbsp;as&nbsp;his chance to&nbsp;mold the perfect wife for himself. He&nbsp;once <a href=#>told</a> his friend: “She’s young enough that&nbsp;I can train her any way I&nbsp;want.”</p><p>Priscilla <a href=#>recollects</a> that Elvis shared his idea with her of&nbsp;a&nbsp;perfect woman and his desire to&nbsp;turn Priscilla into one. “On&nbsp;nights when his mood was calm and peaceful, he&nbsp;would describe his ideal woman and tell me&nbsp;how perfectly&nbsp;I fit this image. He&nbsp;liked soft-spoken brunettes with blue eyes. He&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;mold me&nbsp;into his opinions and preferences. Fidelity was very important to&nbsp;him, especially on&nbsp;the woman’s part.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9de/0ee/f7b1fa5132b269437ef44f8e95.jpg><p><h2>Marriage and family life</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f3b/000/80bdcb5caa8649877806684b8e.jpg><p>In&nbsp;1960, Elvis left Germany, while Priscilla and her family stayed. The 2&nbsp;would occasionally see each other when he&nbsp;asked her to&nbsp;come to&nbsp;the USA, and this continued for several years before they finally got married. Priscilla <a href=#>remembers</a> those years as&nbsp;a&nbsp;“suspended animation” where she would wait for Elvis’s infrequent calls and count the days to&nbsp;their next meeting. She also <a href=#>heard</a> a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;gossip about his love affairs with other women, ranging from the girl next door to&nbsp;celebrities.</p><p>Elvis <a href=#>proposed</a> in&nbsp;1966, and the 2&nbsp;got married in&nbsp;Las Vegas on&nbsp;May&nbsp;1, 1967. Elvis felt pressured to&nbsp;marry because he&nbsp;was afraid of&nbsp;a&nbsp;potential scandal that could take place if&nbsp;he&nbsp;didn’t. He&nbsp;<a href=#>continued</a> to&nbsp;change his wife to&nbsp;fully meet his expectations. Priscilla, who later <a href=#>called</a> herself “Elvis’s living doll” put porcelain caps on&nbsp;her teeth, improved her posture, dyed her hair black, and put it&nbsp;in&nbsp;an&nbsp;updo to&nbsp;match the image of&nbsp;the King.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/06a/4df/5a798e59eba2cd67ab73652a69.jpg><p>On&nbsp;February&nbsp;1, 1968, Priscilla gave birth to&nbsp;their daughter, Lisa Marie. After Priscilla became a&nbsp;mother, she felt that Elvis <a href=#>lost</a> his interest in&nbsp;her. Just like before their marriage, he&nbsp;<a href=#>kept</a> having love affairs with other women, and Priscilla kept finding love letters addressed to&nbsp;her husband. As&nbsp;time went&nbsp;by, she realized that she was not willing to&nbsp;put up&nbsp;with that and just wait around for him at&nbsp;home.</p><p>“My&nbsp;life was his life. He&nbsp;had to&nbsp;be&nbsp;happy. My&nbsp;problems were secondary. I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;grow. I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;do&nbsp;things,” she <a href=#>said</a> in&nbsp;one of&nbsp;her interviews. She got tired of&nbsp;the pressure of&nbsp;living up&nbsp;to&nbsp;her husband’s expectations. She <a href=#>admits</a> that she never appeared before his eyes without makeup and never got dressed in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;him: “He&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;see the end result.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2e8/8cd/b835f65918b615c4fc8b35f304.jpg><p><h2>Divorce and the King’s decline</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/874/aa0/7e0a13567a9274d49d84782358.jpg><p>In&nbsp;1972, Priscilla <a href=#>told</a> Elvis she was leaving him, and soon the 2&nbsp;divorced and shared custody of&nbsp;their daughter. While the single Priscilla blossomed and tried to&nbsp;finally gain control of&nbsp;her own life, Elvis became <a href=#>addicted</a> to&nbsp;prescription drugs and was having financial difficulties. He&nbsp;<a href=#>had</a> several love affairs after his marriage with Priscilla was over, and proposed to&nbsp;Ginger Alden.</p><p>Their marriage, however, was not meant to&nbsp;be. On&nbsp;August&nbsp;16, 1977 Elvis was <a href=#>found</a> dead. He&nbsp;was 42. Priscilla was devastated when she learned Elvis was gone, and she just <a href=#>couldn’t</a> believe&nbsp;it. She had <a href=#>hoped</a> that Elvis would’ve checked into a&nbsp;hospital to&nbsp;hide from the public eye, stay alone for a&nbsp;while, and come back later. “It&nbsp;was shocking. Like to&nbsp;the world, only a&nbsp;million times more,” she <a href=#>confessed</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/34c/7a6/258bd95ce092b488171a339624.jpg><p>Despite the divorce and tense marriage, Priscilla and Elvis remained close. She <a href=#>remembers</a> how he&nbsp;used to&nbsp;call her to&nbsp;share his worries, and how she cherished every call. After the divorce, Priscilla launched her career as&nbsp;an&nbsp;actress and a&nbsp;business woman. She never got married again, but she did have a&nbsp;long relationship in&nbsp;which she gave birth to&nbsp;her son, Navarone.</p><p>She <a href=#>opened</a> the house in&nbsp;Graceland to&nbsp;tourists so&nbsp;that she could have the opportunity to&nbsp;pay taxes and bills, without selling the house where she and Elvis lived together as&nbsp;a&nbsp;family. Graceland has <a href=#>become</a> the second most visited home in&nbsp;the USA ,after the White House. Priscilla faithfully keeps the good memories of&nbsp;her ex-husband alive, takes part in&nbsp;events devoted to&nbsp;his music, and still <a href=#>calls</a> him “the love of&nbsp;her life.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2e7/0be/cb766551ac8643a563e01653f0.jpg><p>How do&nbsp;you feel after reading Elvis and Priscilla’s love story?
