<time>29 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Oscar Wilde is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most popular English authors that many people know thanks to&nbsp;his trenchant comments and the very famous novel The Picture of&nbsp;Dorian Gray. His plays are still successfully shown around the world and his novels are often quoted. Wilde believed that beauty was the most important thing and he&nbsp;didn’t want to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;humble life.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> decided to&nbsp;dive deep into the biography of&nbsp;this amazing writer that the people of&nbsp;Great Britain <a href=#>think</a> is&nbsp;“the greatest wit” of&nbsp;all time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3dc/009/43b5b75a0ab058271a7e2250af.jpg><p>Oscar Wilde as&nbsp;a&nbsp;child. At&nbsp;the time, children of&nbsp;both sexes wore dresses.</p><ul><li>Oscar Wilde was born on&nbsp;October 16th,1854 in&nbsp;Dublin. His father, Sir William Wilde, was Ireland’s leading oto-ophthalmologic (ear and eye) <a href=#>surgeon</a>. Besides that, he&nbsp;wrote books about Irish archaeology and folklore and opened a&nbsp;free medical center for poor people.</li><li>Oscar’s mother, Jane Wilde, wrote poems and was an&nbsp;unusual woman. She felt that she was born to&nbsp;do&nbsp;something great and she didn’t hide&nbsp;it. Oscar himself felt like something special. <strong>This is&nbsp;why he&nbsp;liked to&nbsp;tweak reality</strong> and even on&nbsp;his <a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a> certificate, he&nbsp;wrote the wrong date of&nbsp;his birth, lowering his age by&nbsp;2&nbsp;years.</li><li>Oscar <a href=#>had</a> a&nbsp;little sister named Isola who died of&nbsp;meningitis at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;10&nbsp;and an&nbsp;older brother named William. The boys were similar to&nbsp;each other: both of&nbsp;them had a&nbsp;predisposition for extra weight and they were a&nbsp;bit lazy. Oscar didn’t like these similarities and once he&nbsp;even paid his brother to&nbsp;grow a&nbsp;beard so&nbsp;they wouldn’t look alike.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/620/e37/43d39f59ca80ee210085d3aaec.jpg><ul><li>Before the age of&nbsp;9, the future writer studied at&nbsp;home and he&nbsp;quickly learned the French and German languages. Then, he&nbsp;entered the Portora Royal School <strong>where he&nbsp;became popular for being able to&nbsp;parody the school events and giving nicknames to&nbsp;everyone</strong>. People thought he&nbsp;was a&nbsp;genius because he&nbsp;could scan a&nbsp;3-book novel in&nbsp;30&nbsp;minutes and talk about what the plot was about. After an&nbsp;hour of&nbsp;reading, he&nbsp;could even retell some scenes and important dialogues. Before his exams, he&nbsp;never really learned anything and read the literature he&nbsp;had to&nbsp;read because he&nbsp;wanted&nbsp;to. He&nbsp;finished school with a&nbsp;gold medal.</li><li>At&nbsp;Trinity College, Wilde discovered his talent for studying ancient languages. At&nbsp;the same time, he&nbsp;got really interested in&nbsp;aestheticism (the movement whose followers believe that beauty is&nbsp;above everything, even morals). His original style in&nbsp;<a href=# title=clothes data-link=tag>clothes</a> and self-mockery also appeared at&nbsp;that time.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a2f/ad3/a137e3545e953f1d6ef255bd69.jpg><ul><li>In&nbsp;1874, Oscar entered Magdalene College in&nbsp;Oxford, where he&nbsp;tried to&nbsp;be&nbsp;better than everyone else. He&nbsp;bought tweed suits with brighter patterns than his groupmates, he&nbsp;wore hats that were tilted on&nbsp;his head. Once, Oscar even made himself a&nbsp;jacket he&nbsp;saw in&nbsp;a&nbsp;dream. The jacket had shades of&nbsp;bronze and red, and from the back, it&nbsp;looked like a&nbsp;cello. This was the first stage of&nbsp;Wilde’s revolution in&nbsp;clothes.</li><li>Back when he&nbsp;was in&nbsp;school, Oscar wore purple and bright red shirts, and instead of&nbsp;the regular books like everyone else had, he&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;have big books. When he&nbsp;was at&nbsp;Oxford, Wilde started to&nbsp;pay even more attention to&nbsp;clothes. <strong>He&nbsp;even once said that if&nbsp;he&nbsp;were alone on&nbsp;a&nbsp;deserted island, he&nbsp;would still change clothes for dinner.</strong></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/97b/f6d/464d745de0afe85d2cba2da17d.jpg><ul><li>Oscar grew long hair, he&nbsp;despised “men’s sports” even though he&nbsp;boxed from time to&nbsp;time, and he&nbsp;decorated his rooms with peacock feathers, lilies, sunflowers, and pieces of&nbsp;art. <strong>He&nbsp;wore really bright clothes, which is&nbsp;why some people thought he&nbsp;was crazy and others despised him</strong>. Once, the groupmates that didn’t like him, grabbed him and dragged to&nbsp;the top of&nbsp;a&nbsp;high hill. But Oscar found a&nbsp;great solution to&nbsp;this silly situation. He&nbsp;stood&nbsp;up, dusted himself off, and said that the view from that hill was stunning.</li><li>Even though he&nbsp;didn’t look like&nbsp;it, he&nbsp;was pretty strong. Once, 4&nbsp;students decided to&nbsp;beat Wilde and wreck his place. But they didn’t know what was coming: he&nbsp;threw one of&nbsp;them out, beat the second one, threw the third one down the stairs, and pushed the fourth one under his furniture.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/786/433/315183507899495df263ec3f05.jpg><ul><li>When he&nbsp;finished his studies, Oscar went to&nbsp;London. <strong>Thanks to&nbsp;his trenchant comments and his behavior, he&nbsp;was quickly accepted into the community there</strong>. Wilde became a&nbsp;welcome guest in&nbsp;any group.</li><li>Once, he&nbsp;met Lillie Langtry, who later became a&nbsp;famous actress (not without Oscar’s help.) Even though she was married, Wilde dedicated poems to&nbsp;her and tried to&nbsp;spend as&nbsp;much time with her as&nbsp;possible. Once, Wilde waited the entire night for her to&nbsp;return home and her husband even tripped over Oscar because he&nbsp;didn’t see him in&nbsp;the darkness.</li></ul><p class=adme-img-description>Lillie Langtry</p><ul><li>Trying to&nbsp;become famous, Wilde agreed to&nbsp;give lectures about aestheticism and went on&nbsp;a&nbsp;tour that later became famous. <strong>When he&nbsp;was at&nbsp;US customs, he&nbsp;said he&nbsp;had “nothing to&nbsp;<a href=#>declare</a> but his genius.”</strong></li><li>The first lecture was extremely successful and people applauded him. But not all of&nbsp;his performances were that successful. The press was quite hostile, and so&nbsp;were many local people. On&nbsp;Wall Street, Wilde even had to&nbsp;run away.</li><li>The writer also had to&nbsp;perform in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;miners who warmly welcomed him, and Wilde even said that the miners were very well-behaved compared to&nbsp;the people he&nbsp;met in&nbsp;big cities.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0c6/c48/4d2606504ca05bdd267fd8de0c.jpg><ul><li>When he&nbsp;returned home, Oscar met Constance Lloyd, the daughter of&nbsp;a&nbsp;famous Irish lawyer, and he&nbsp;married her. When he&nbsp;was asked why he&nbsp;fell in&nbsp;love with her, Oscar said that it&nbsp;was because she didn’t speak much.</li><li>Wilde wore very provocative clothes and made his wife do&nbsp;the same thing. <strong>Once, she had to&nbsp;wear a&nbsp;dress made of&nbsp;old white muslin and bright-yellow stockings.</strong> People thought that her clothes were tasteless and Constance herself was shy and boring.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/80f/c9d/0b73175689a5b5a50c2b27c7a4.jpg><ul><li>Over time, Wilde’s love for his wife started to&nbsp;die down. <strong>When she got pregnant, there were rumors that he&nbsp;was disgusted by&nbsp;her</strong>. He&nbsp;even said that when he&nbsp;got married, she was a&nbsp;charming girl, white and slender like a&nbsp;lily. And one year later, she became heavy and shapeless.</li><li>But they still had 2&nbsp;sons, Cyril and Vyvyan. Oscar wrote tales for them that he&nbsp;later published. Then he&nbsp;<a href=#>became</a> the editor of&nbsp;Woman’s World where he&nbsp;added serious articles about child rearing, culture, and politics.</li></ul><p><h2>Oscar with his wife Constance and son Cyril</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/31f/df0/caab7959699fbf01d3848432cc.jpg><ul><li>After his trip to&nbsp;the US, Wilde stopped wearing his suits. <strong>There was almost nothing left of&nbsp;the gentleman with long hair walking around Piccadilly with a&nbsp;sunflower in&nbsp;his hand</strong>. The Punch newspaper even printed a&nbsp;joke, “That there were a&nbsp;whole stock of&nbsp;trade faded lilies, dilapidated sunflowers, and shabby peacock feathers, several long-haired wigs, a&nbsp;collection of&nbsp;incomprehensible poems, and a&nbsp;number of&nbsp;impossible pictures for sale.”</li><li>Wilde decided to&nbsp;cut his long hair and to&nbsp;make the hairdresser understand what hairstyle he&nbsp;wanted, he&nbsp;took him to&nbsp;the Louvre and showed him a&nbsp;Roman marble bust.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/aca/b64/153cd65abab700b97ba6a5eb5f.jpg><ul><li>In&nbsp;1890, Wilde published his novel The Picture of&nbsp;Dorian Gray, which brought him amazing success and a&nbsp;<a href=#>charge</a> of&nbsp;immorality. Oscar wrote more than 10&nbsp;open letters to&nbsp;the editorials of&nbsp;British newspapers and magazines explaining that art doesn’t depend on&nbsp;morality. One year later, the novel was published with a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;additions and a&nbsp;foreword from the author.</li><li>From 1891 to&nbsp;1895 was a&nbsp;period when Wilde was incredibly popular. He&nbsp;wrote the plays Salomé, Lady Windermere’s Fan, An&nbsp;Ideal Husband, and The Importance of&nbsp;Being Earnest, and <strong>he&nbsp;became the most popular person in&nbsp;London</strong>. The newspapers called him one of&nbsp;the best playwrights of&nbsp;the time and praised his style and originality.</li></ul><p class=adme-img-description>Performance of&nbsp;the Oscar Wilde play Lady Windermere’s Fan at&nbsp;the Theatre Royal, 1945</p><ul><li>In&nbsp;1891, Wilde <a href=#>met</a> Alfred Douglas, an&nbsp;attractive and spoiled young man. <strong>This meeting would soon become the biggest tragedy of&nbsp;his life</strong>. Oscar got really interested in&nbsp;Bosie, as&nbsp;Alfred was called, to&nbsp;the point that he&nbsp;would do&nbsp;anything for him. The wife of&nbsp;the writer was <a href=#>worried</a> about the terrible costs and sudden disappearances of&nbsp;Oscar, but he&nbsp;told her that all of&nbsp;this was necessary in&nbsp;order for him to&nbsp;write.</li><li>Douglas didn’t want to&nbsp;hide his relationship with Wilde and wanted everyone to&nbsp;see them together. They went abroad together several times. Soon, the father of&nbsp;Alfred found out about their relationship, and Wilde was sentenced to&nbsp;2&nbsp;<a href=#>years</a> in&nbsp;prison.</li></ul><p><h2>Wilde and Lord Alfred Douglas in 1893</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c90/e50/8607f55339bccc0473a061682d.jpg><ul readability=4.8992890995261><li readability=3.8985200845666><p>Wilde spent the first 6&nbsp;months in&nbsp;prisons for particularly serious crimes and the rest, he&nbsp;spent in&nbsp;the reading prison.<strong> The jail time completely broke the talented writer</strong>. The bad food and difficult conditions made him physically weak and he&nbsp;suffered from illnesses and insomnia. The overseer didn’t like him and punished him for even the slightest mistakes. Once, Oscar fell in&nbsp;the chapel and <a href=#>damaged</a> his eardrum.

He&nbsp;even <a href=#>wrote</a>, “When you are not on&nbsp;your pedestal you are not interesting.” Wilde’s wife, despite what relatives advised, didn’t divorce him and visited him in&nbsp;jail twice.</p></li></ul><p class=adme-img-description>Oscar Wilde abroad after prison</p><ul><li>After he&nbsp;left prison in&nbsp;1897, Oscar moved to&nbsp;<a href=# title=France data-link=tag>France</a>. He&nbsp;was poor and lived off the money his wife sent to&nbsp;him. She didn’t want to&nbsp;see him, but Bosie came. He&nbsp;took advantage of&nbsp;what little money Wilde had, and when Wilde asked him to&nbsp;share the money, he&nbsp;got angry. When the money ended, Bosie left.</li><li>In&nbsp;France, Wilde <a href=#>changed</a> his name to&nbsp;Sebastian Melmoth and wrote the famous poem The Ballad Of&nbsp;Reading Gaol. <strong>He&nbsp;also published several articles with his ideas about how to&nbsp;improve the lives of&nbsp;prisoners.

He&nbsp;was buried in&nbsp;Paris and there was a&nbsp;sphynx with wings put on&nbsp;top of&nbsp;his grave. Over time, a&nbsp;legend appeared that whoever would kiss the sphynx, would find love and never lose it&nbsp;again. The sphynx was <a href=#>covered</a> with so&nbsp;much lipstick that in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;avoid damaging the monument, on&nbsp;November&nbsp;30, 2011, it&nbsp;was surrounded by&nbsp;a&nbsp;fence.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bf9/4a5/3999b35b0297f16475fcff3068.jpg><p>What is&nbsp;your attitude toward the work of&nbsp;Oscar Wilde?
