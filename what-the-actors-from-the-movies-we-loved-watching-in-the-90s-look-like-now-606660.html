<time>23 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Before the age of&nbsp;the internet, young people were not interested in&nbsp;Instagram stars but in&nbsp;actors and actresses that they saw in&nbsp;<a href=# title=movies data-link=tag>movies</a> and&nbsp;TV series. We&nbsp;are always ready to&nbsp;watch some of&nbsp;the old movies again, like <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Leon</i></a><i>, </i><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Beethoven</i></a><i>, </i><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Home Alone</i></a><i>, </i><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Ghostbusters</i></a><i>,</i> and others. But what are the actors that played our favorite characters doing now?</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> decided to&nbsp;answer this question and find out what happened to&nbsp;our favorite actors’ lives and careers.</p><p><h2>1. Alisan Porter</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0a5/a72/ee1a725692b7aa594da287759b.jpg><p>If&nbsp;you don’t know the movie <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Curly Sue</i></a>, it&nbsp;means you didn’t live in&nbsp;the ’90s. Alisan Porter played the role of&nbsp;this charming girl at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;10, but it&nbsp;wasn’t her favorite movie role because by&nbsp;that time she had already starred in&nbsp;several movies and&nbsp;TV series. But after this iconic role, Porter vanished from the big screen after she did several guest roles. She ended up&nbsp;loving her <a href=# title=school data-link=tag>school</a> theater and decided that her place was on&nbsp;the stage.</p><p>And later she developed a&nbsp;completely different hobby. In&nbsp;2016, Alisan made a&nbsp;splash on&nbsp;the American TV&nbsp;show <i>The Voice.</i> She was on&nbsp;Christina Aguilera’s team and was the winner of&nbsp;that season. Porter has been doing <a href=# title=music data-link=tag>music</a> for a&nbsp;long time: she has her own band and she is&nbsp;a&nbsp;songwriter herself. This is&nbsp;how the little Curly Sue became a&nbsp;real star. Now, Alisan continues to&nbsp;develop her music career and is&nbsp;married and has 2&nbsp;children.</p><p><h2>2. Kelly McGillis</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1a0/6ba/3c680f5f6fad53cdc912ddbb4f.jpg><p>Her most famous movies were made at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the ’80s. She was in<i>&nbsp;Witness</i> together with Harrison Ford and the role that made her truly famous was when she played in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Top Gun</i></a> with Tom Cruise. She went on&nbsp;to&nbsp;act in&nbsp;about a&nbsp;dozen more roles but soon after that decided to&nbsp;stop her career and spend more time with her family.</p><p>In&nbsp;the 2000s, she played in&nbsp;several movies, TV&nbsp;series, and also acted in&nbsp;some plays on&nbsp;<a href=# title=Broadway data-link=tag>Broadway</a>. Now, McGillis, who has 2&nbsp;adult daughters, rarely appears in&nbsp;public.</p><p><h2>3. Meg Ryan</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f01/14d/c2856057be92ff15c52bb6c075.jpg><p>Meg Ryan was a&nbsp;star of&nbsp;romantic <a href=# title=comedies data-link=tag>comedies</a> and dramas of&nbsp;the ’90s. Fans love her for her roles in&nbsp;<i>Sleepless in&nbsp;Seattle, </i><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>When Harry Met Sally</i></a><i>, You’ve Got Mail, Addicted to&nbsp;Love, Kate &&nbsp;Leopold,</i> and a&nbsp;few other movies. Her career was progressing very fast, but in&nbsp;the 2000s something went wrong and her movies started to&nbsp;get bad reviews. Her roles started to&nbsp;get taken by&nbsp;other young actresses.</p><p>Sometimes Meg attends celebrity events and also takes part in&nbsp;projects like being the voice for one of&nbsp;the characters in&nbsp;<i>Inside Out.</i></p><p><h2>4. Christopher Castile</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/22c/e29/ff10965286a2ef9a70b3bfad19.jpg><p>Do&nbsp;you remember this boy from <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Beethoven</i></a>? After the end of&nbsp;the shooting, Castile took part in&nbsp;several movies for&nbsp;TV but later decided to&nbsp;not work in&nbsp;cinema. Christopher got his bachelor’s degree at&nbsp;Biola University in&nbsp;California and now works as&nbsp;a&nbsp;history teacher. The Downey Legend did an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a> with him where Castile said that working as&nbsp;an&nbsp;actor is&nbsp;much more tiring than working as&nbsp;a&nbsp;teacher. He&nbsp;loves teaching and seeing his students’ faces every day. It’s great that he&nbsp;found something he&nbsp;really loves doing in&nbsp;his life.</p><p><h2>5. Nicholle Tom</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cf6/491/685c3b5299a6e7c9e5ebdade64.jpg><p>Nicholle is&nbsp;famous for her roles in&nbsp;<i>The Nanny</i> and <i>Beverly Hills, 90210</i>, but people only knew her for her role in&nbsp;<i>Beethoven</i>. Unlike her colleague, Nicholle didn’t stop her career as&nbsp;an&nbsp;actress: she’s continued working in&nbsp;movies and on&nbsp;TV series but hasn’t done many roles recently. Now, Nicholle is&nbsp;40&nbsp;years old and she looks amazing. Judging by&nbsp;her Instagram account, she, like her character from <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Beethoven</i></a>, loves dogs: she has a&nbsp;charming poodle and posts her pet’s photos regularly.</p><p><h2>6. Marlon Wayans</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/407/ef4/7f6ae358b881bc4b061e0a86b1.jpg><p>It&nbsp;looks like we’ve found another Keanu Reeves. Judging by&nbsp;his photos, this actor, who was popular in&nbsp;the ’90s, hasn’t changed much for the past 20&nbsp;years. He&nbsp;has done many movies which are popular among young people, like <i>Senseless, </i><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Scary Movie</i></a><i>, Requiem for a&nbsp;Dream, Don’t Be&nbsp;a&nbsp;Menace to&nbsp;South Central While Drinking Your Juice in&nbsp;the Hood</i>, and others. He&nbsp;not only acts in&nbsp;movies, but also works as&nbsp;a&nbsp;scriptwriter, director, and producer.</p><p>Now, Marlon is&nbsp;49&nbsp;years old, he&nbsp;continues his movie career, and he&nbsp;is&nbsp;happily married with 2&nbsp;children.</p><p><h2>7. Matthew Lillard</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/275/0af/cd3c4a50e5b5dde37d55d74a1e.jpg><p>People remember this actor well thanks to&nbsp;his roles where he&nbsp;played rebels in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Scream</i></a><i>, Senseless, SLC&nbsp;Punk!</i>, and others. Lillard is&nbsp;still making many movies. In&nbsp;2017, he&nbsp;appeared in&nbsp;several episodes of&nbsp;the new <i>Twin Peaks</i> season where he&nbsp;played the school’s principal. In&nbsp;2012, he&nbsp;directed the comedy film <i>Fat Kid Rules the World</i>. He&nbsp;has been married since 2000 and has 3&nbsp;children.</p><p><h2>8. Bill Murray</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5bd/491/0251ce5dce803a908ae7b9f7a7.jpg><p>This great actor’s career was at&nbsp;its peak in&nbsp;the ’90s. Both children and parents love his movies. He&nbsp;played a&nbsp;scientist in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Ghostbusters</i></a> and a&nbsp;meteorologist in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Groundhog Day</i></a>. Soon, Murray started choosing more dramatic roles and became an&nbsp;irreplaceable actor in&nbsp;Wes Anderson movies: he’s played in&nbsp;almost all of&nbsp;his works. One of&nbsp;his more iconic roles was in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Lost in&nbsp;Translation</i></a> directed by&nbsp;Sofia Coppola.</p><p>Now Murray is&nbsp;71&nbsp;years old, he&nbsp;doesn’t play in&nbsp;movies as&nbsp;often as&nbsp;he&nbsp;used to&nbsp;but he&nbsp;doesn’t refuse interesting roles either. He&nbsp;also made a&nbsp;small cameo appearance in&nbsp;the reboot of&nbsp;<i>Ghostbusters</i> in&nbsp;2016.</p><p><h2>9. Alicia Silverstone</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/418/fa0/fedd3c516a804af92aa6c195c9.jpg><p>Do&nbsp;you remember the main character of&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most famous comedies of&nbsp;the ’90s, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Clueless</i></a>? This role instantly made <a href=# title="Alicia Silverstone" data-link=tag>Alicia Silverstone</a> famous. Alicia also starred in&nbsp;several clips of&nbsp;an&nbsp;Aerosmith video and was even kind of&nbsp;a&nbsp;symbol of&nbsp;the band. Silverstone played in&nbsp;some really successful movies, like <i>Batman and Robin</i> (with Arnold Schwarzenegger), <i>Excess Baggage</i> (with Benicio Del Toro), and <i>Blast from the Past.</i></p><p>Unfortunately, she didn’t have a&nbsp;very successful career later&nbsp;on. Silverstone starred in&nbsp;movies and&nbsp;TV series but her works were never very successful. Alicia is&nbsp;a&nbsp;famous animal activist and is&nbsp;also a&nbsp;vegetarian.</p><p><h2>10. Jean Reno</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/674/19a/4df371580a9cdfb5dee8cea417.jpg><p>We&nbsp;would say that Jean Reno deserves to&nbsp;be&nbsp;remembered forever just for the role in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Leon</i></a> alone. It&nbsp;was one of&nbsp;the best movies of&nbsp;the ’90s. The character he&nbsp;portrayed became iconic and made the French actor popular among Hollywood producers. In&nbsp;the&nbsp;US, he&nbsp;made movies like <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Da&nbsp;Vinci Code</i></a><i>, </i><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Ronin</i></a><i>, </i><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Godzilla</i></a><i>,</i> and others. By&nbsp;the way, Reno turned down the role of&nbsp;Agent Smith in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Matrix</i></a> for the role in&nbsp;<i>Godzilla</i>. Now, the actor doesn’t do&nbsp;many roles and if&nbsp;he&nbsp;does, they are usually small.</p><p><h2>11. Andie MacDowell</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c9f/987/d741a55684bdffbf71dfff1216.jpg><p>Andie started her career as&nbsp;a&nbsp;really successful model and only after that did she start starring in&nbsp;movies. The viewers of&nbsp;the ’90s probably remember her well for the movies <i>Green Card, Groundhog Day</i>, and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Four Weddings and a&nbsp;Funeral</i></a>. But most of&nbsp;the projects she did later were not successful and soon MacDowell only worked on&nbsp;smaller projects.</p><p>In&nbsp;the 2000s, Andie returned to&nbsp;working as&nbsp;a&nbsp;model and she is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the main faces of&nbsp;L’Oréal. She has 3&nbsp;adult children: her son is&nbsp;far from show business and her daughters are trying their luck in&nbsp;movies and the modeling business.</p><p><h2>12. Nicolas Cage</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e9c/55e/3330745b5fbaf504f3b5e4b334.jpg><p><a href=# title="Nicolas Cage" data-link=tag>Nicolas Cage</a>’s career was also at&nbsp;its peak in&nbsp;the ’90s. He&nbsp;played in<i>&nbsp;The Rock, Face/Off, Con Air, </i><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Gone in&nbsp;Sixty Seconds</i></a>, and many others. Despite the great amounts of&nbsp;money Cage used to&nbsp;make, he&nbsp;was in&nbsp;financial trouble because of&nbsp;long lawsuits with his ex-wives and his love for a&nbsp;cool life.</p><p>In&nbsp;the 2000s, his career fell off the rails and his movies began to&nbsp;fail one after another. But it&nbsp;seems that despite all the fails, Cage managed to&nbsp;overcome these difficulties. In&nbsp;2018, the horror film <i>Mandy</i> was released where Nicolas played the main role. This movie of&nbsp;his finally got very good reviews, Thrillist even called <i>Mandy</i> Nicolas Cage’s best movie in&nbsp;the recent past. In&nbsp;the movie, the main character’s life is&nbsp;ruined and he&nbsp;becomes obsessed with revenge. We&nbsp;hope that the actor has a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;really good roles ahead of&nbsp;him. Good luck, Nicolas!</p><p><h2>13. Jeff Daniels</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6f1/87d/44ff4753208dfc3ff1830f2b2d.jpg><p>Do&nbsp;you remember Jim Carrey’s partner from <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Dumb &&nbsp;Dumber</i></a>? This is&nbsp;the movie that made Jeff Daniels widely popular. In&nbsp;the ’90s he&nbsp;took part in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>One Hundred and One Dalmatians</i></a><i> </i>and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Pleasantville</i></a>. At&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;his career he&nbsp;mostly played roles in&nbsp;comedies, now he&nbsp;chooses more dramatic parts, like his roles in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>My&nbsp;Favorite Martian</i></a>. The actor is&nbsp;still very popular in&nbsp;movies, he&nbsp;is&nbsp;happily married and has 3&nbsp;children.</p><p><h2>Bonus: Maggie Wheeler, Janice from “Friends”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4a9/0c8/38c3da54569ae5b489a7aa6ce8.jpg><p>The ’90s were also all about the show <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Friends</i></a>. We’ve followed the lives and careers of&nbsp;the people who played the main roles, but on&nbsp;that show there was at&nbsp;least one more interesting character who everyone remembers. Of&nbsp;course we&nbsp;mean Janice, Chandler’s ex-girlfriend. Admit&nbsp;it, you can hear her laughter right when you see her picture.</p><p>Maggie Wheeler is&nbsp;the name of&nbsp;the actress who played the character Janice. It’s amazing that it’s been more than 20&nbsp;years since she started playing this character and she basically hasn’t changed a&nbsp;bit. Now, she is&nbsp;60&nbsp;years old. You can find her in&nbsp;several shows: <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>How I&nbsp;Met Your Mother</i></a><i>, </i><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Californication</i></a><i>, </i><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Shameless</i></a>, and others. But we&nbsp;think she hasn’t managed to&nbsp;play someone funnier than Janice. She is&nbsp;married and has 2&nbsp;daughters.</p><p>Whose transformation amazed you the most?
