The pair had plenty to celebrate: This past season, Wiig starred as a would-be socialite trying to claw her way into the in crowd on Apple TV+’s “Palm Royale.” Hamm also played a gleefully ambitious character for Apple, as an Elon Musk-type billionaire attempting to become a media mogul on the third season of “The Morning Show.” But an even bigger turn came with Noah Hawley’s “Fargo” from FX, where his devious Sheriff Roy Tillman runs roughshod over all those in his way — after making a very memorable entrance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Variety-Actors-on-Actors-Wiig-Hamm.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>KRISTEN WIIG: </strong>What’s up, Hamm?</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>JON HAMM:</strong> I have not seen you in forever, even though we just did the show together.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>WIIG:</strong> Before that, it was a long time. We did not see each other during COVID; we followed the rules. I still follow them.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>HAMM: </strong>We’re six feet apart, and I’m wearing a mask right now. It’s just a mask that’s my face.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>WIIG:</strong> Why didn’t anyone make those? “Just send in a photo of your face.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>HAMM:</strong> A KN95, but with something fun on it.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>WIIG: </strong>Don’t air this, because someone’s going to steal it.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>HAMM: </strong>We can retire on that one.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>WIIG:</strong> Can I give you a compliment?</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>HAMM:</strong> Sure. It may be the first time in your life.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>WIIG: </strong>You are amazing on “Fargo” and “The Morning Show” — two different characters.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>HAMM:</strong> Very different. Shot at the same time.I was shooting on parallel tracks, flying back from Calgary to Los Angeles.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>WIIG: </strong>Let’s talk about your character in “Fargo,” who I heard you said was visually based on the Marlboro Man.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>HAMM: </strong>That was Noah’s hope. What he was trying to do was explode this idea of this rugged individualist that seems to be a very popular idea right now: a sovereign citizen, “No one can tell me what to do.” This onanistic, narcissistic idea about what being an individual has to be: You’re free from the constraints of government and society.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Well, of course, that’s impossible. But there are people who subscribe to that. And when they take it to the extreme, this is what you get: the guy where the rules don’t apply because he makes the rules. I think it’s a cautionary tale; we need to live in a society that has rules. And we can point to one obvious orange example of that right now, who’s kind of bumping up against the rules as well.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>WIIG: </strong>Did you know how it would end?</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>HAMM: </strong>I didn’t think it was going to end great for my guy. You couldn’t have that guy get away scot-free.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>WIIG: </strong>When we meet Roy — you have quite an entrance, or should I say a “rising up” out of the water. You are in full nipple piercings.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>HAMM: </strong>Completely naked. I was wearing a little thing around my junk. A sock around my junk. A junk sock. There’s a process of making fake nipples that stick onto my real nipples that have little earrings in them.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>WIIG: </strong>Was it like an adhesive? What are we talking here?</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>HAMM: </strong>It’s a little latex situation. There’s a picture of me with two little blue latex things on my nipples that I’ll send you. And then on the day, I’m going to sit in this hot tub with a weird beige bag around my junk.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>WIIG: </strong>Was it cold?</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>HAMM: </strong>It was a hot tub. It was nice. But the backdrop of the mountains and what is meant to be the upper Midwest was actually filmed in Calgary in freezing cold — minus 20 degrees.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Speaking of cold, “Palm Royale.” It didn’t look cold. The opposite of cold. Warm? I’d like to go with warm.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>WIIG:</strong> Great segue.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>HAMM: </strong>Tell me about how it came about. I haven’t finished it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Kristen-Wiig-Variety-Actors-on-Actors.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>WIIG:</strong> That’s OK — I haven’t finished yours either.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>HAMM: </strong>But I am watching and loving it. This means we haven’t seen any of it.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>WIIG: </strong>This means we watched the trailer. But you know what? Just watch how we fake it.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>HAMM:</strong> Fake it till you make it. But how did it come about? You didn’t write it.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>WIIG:</strong> It came to me through this actress. I don’t know if you’ve heard of her — her name is Laura Dern.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>HAMM: </strong>Oh, Bruce Dern’s kid. It’s amazing because it’s so midcentury and feels of that time. It must have been a fun place to be.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>WIIG: </strong>It was. And I obviously learned more about it after being part of the show. Slim Aarons photos and things like this. Nowhere else in the country were they dressed like that. It’s this weird vortex of pastels and day drinking.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>HAMM:</strong> It’s such an amazing cast to be able to hang in that space with. Especially with Carol Burnett, who lived through it.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>WIIG:</strong> I could talk about Carol Burnett for 20 minutes. She’s a fucking legend. I grew up watching her. She influenced so many people in sketch comedy. And being a woman at that time, with her own show. She shows up on set, she’s talking to everyone, she knows everyone’s name, she’s telling stories. She hangs out on set and just talks to people. And she’s such a light — people lit up around her.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>HAMM: </strong>I like to hear that. Because all the things we’ve worked on together, part of it is to not get too jaded or too over it or feel like, “Ugh, I’ve got to be here.” We get to be here. It’s such a gift to be able to do what we do. I still love doing it.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>WIIG: </strong>Me too.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>HAMM: </strong>When they called and asked if I could do your “SNL” when you hosted for the fifth time — congratulations! — I was like, there’s never an answer that doesn’t rhyme with “Yeah.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>WIIG: </strong>You could have gone with “Nah.” That kind of rhymes.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>HAMM:</strong> Any time you say, “Come do anything,” I’ll do it. When you said, “Please be in ‘Bridesmaids,’” I was like, “Sure.” And you were like, “We haven’t written a part yet.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>WIIG: </strong>And we had so much fun. It’s so funny because obviously you’re known for Don Draper at that point. People are known for that thing, and when there’s something else, people are so surprised.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>HAMM:</strong> I think happily. It’s like a discovery.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>WIIG: </strong>Because it’s like, “And he’s funny!” When you did “SNL”—</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Jon-Hamm-Variety-Actors-on-Actors.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>HAMM:</strong> Do you remember? On Monday, when you come in as the host, there was a big meeting in Lorne’s office. And all the writers are there, and the cast is there, and everybody jams into the small office, and everybody was in “Mad Men” drag. Which was very strange.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>WIIG: </strong>We never do that. I don’t think we’ve ever done it since.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>HAMM: </strong>Bill Hader was in drag. Paula Pell had a cigarette taped to her finger because she didn’t know how to smoke. Colin Jost is two years out of Harvard and looks like a total Staten Island dirtbag.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>WIIG: </strong>Do you remember that group? “Mad Men,” “The Office,” “SNL” — we kind of all ran with each other.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>HAMM: </strong>Everybody gelled at the same time. It was such a moment in time of distilled fun.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>WIIG:</strong> You were always so game when you came to the show.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>HAMM:</strong> I hosted three times in two years and then never again. The fun part of “SNL” — one time I was hosting, and we both had quick changes next to each other. And you’re like, “Get ready,” and then we’re both naked. They’re literally tearing clothes off of you. You just have to go with it.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>WIIG: </strong>The last time I was back, I had a quick change. They were stripping me, and I looked over, and Kenan [Thompson] was doing the same thing. I was like, “Oh, we’ve seen each other.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>HAMM: </strong>All of the parts. It’s fine. It’s only awkward because you have to submit to it. You’re a total mannequin.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>WIIG: </strong>The “in-between sketches” is the most interesting — it’s such a beautiful dance.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>HAMM: </strong>And you never see the seams. My first time hosting was right in the middle of [your time]. And then I hosted three times, and we worked together so much. And then I was at your last show, which was so awesome and fun and, I’m sure, tremendously emotional for you.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>WIIG:</strong> I was so emotional that week. I cried during read-through, I sobbed after readthrough, and I just didn’t want to cry on air. And I didn’t really, even though it was one of the most emotional nights of my life. And then with Five-Timers, I surprised myself that I got a little emotional at the end. I still can’t even explain why. The other times I’ve hosted, it’s weird to go back, seeing the other side of the curtain.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>HAMM:</strong> Everybody that I know that’s gone back and hosted, from Tina [Fey] to Bill [Hader] to you, has said it’s a real mindfuck. It’s a weird gear shift.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>WIIG:</strong> Do you find as you’ve gotten older and worked more, you gravitate toward the things that are more joyful and fun?</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>HAMM:</strong> Well, yeah, because there’s so many definitions of that. For “Fargo,” I’ll go play a bad guy who’s morally reprehensible, who has all of these terrible things about him, in the freezing cold, but I’m still having fun. To lean into the aspect of it that is joyful and fun, I think that resonates off the screen. And when I look at your career, every time I see you in something, I’ll say, “Oh, my God, you’re so good in this.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>WIIG: </strong>There’re some things you haven’t reached out about. We haven’t talked about “The Morning Show,” which I love. You had a lot of scenes with Billy [Crudup] — he’s so good.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>HAMM: </strong>The first time I saw Billy Crudup was onstage in 1995. I was teaching school, and during spring break, teachers get spring break too. I was teaching acting and I wanted to be an actor, so I was like, “I’m going to go to New York City. I’m going to stay on my friend’s couch, and I’m going to see plays.” I saw Billy Crudup in “Arcadia” by Tom Stoppard, one of my favorite plays. And he was so good in it, I was like, “Maybe I could do this for a living.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>WIIG: </strong>He was my first on-screen kiss.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>HAMM: </strong>Billy Crudup?</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>WIIG: </strong>Oh, my God, I’m forgetting the name of the movie. “Pretty Bird.” I was so nervous. I remember talking to the director, because I was like, “I don’t know what I’m supposed to do. Is it, like, go in with tongue?” And he was like, “No, do not do that.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>HAMM:</strong> We kissed on-screen in “Bridesmaids.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>WIIG: </strong>That was the last day of shooting.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>HAMM:</strong> Everybody knew each other, and I didn’t know anybody except for Paul [Feig] and you. So all of that stuff in the bed at the beginning of the movie? Everybody just wanted to leave. And we were goofing around.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>WIIG: </strong>No, they were like, “Wow, Jon Hamm!” Are you kidding me? I disagree.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>HAMM: </strong>I definitely felt the last-day energy. And we could not keep it together remotely. It was the dumbest.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>WIIG: </strong>It was so fun because it was so loose: “What if we do this? What if we try this?”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>HAMM: </strong>And Paul Feig yelling sex instructions. “Put her leg over your shoulder!” “OK!” We’re in naked bodysuits. Dumb and fun. And you and Annie [Mumolo] made one of the best comedies of all time. And you got nominated for an Oscar.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>WIIG: </strong>And you’re in it. And you made it great.
