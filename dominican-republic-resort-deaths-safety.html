In a statement, the hotel clarified that it was doing this based on “guest feedback” and to “enhance safety moving forward,” not due to reports that some U.S. tourist deaths may have been caused by tainted alcohol. Neither U.S. nor Dominican officials have confirmed reports that authorities were investigating tainted alcohol.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">According to Hard Rock, in addition to removing the liquor dispensers, all alcohol on the property will be brand-name and sourced from the U.S. except speciality drinks from the Dominican Republic, including Presidente beer.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Additionally, Hard Rock’s Punta Cana location will hire a U.S.-based healthcare facility and will contract a U.S.-based 3rd party testing lab to inspect and test all food and beverages.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The headlines about American tourists dying and have fueled speculation among travelers that the Caribbean country is an unsafe destination for travelers.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Safety concerns began to arise in May, when three seemingly healthy American tourists suddenly died in the same resort within the same week. The FBI has confirmed that it is assisting Dominican police with the investigations. The State Department said there has been no evidence of foul play and no sign that the deaths are connected.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Despite the tragic headlines, safety experts are cautioning travelers not to rush to conclusions. The connections, they say, are not immediately apparent and safety experts in particular say that the country is no more dangerous than it was before.<br>“It’s not an overly dangerous place,” Matthew Bradley, a former CIA agent and current Regional Security Director of International SOS, a travel security company, tells TIME. “I would still consider the Dominican Republic a safe place to go.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">According to the State Department, last year 13 U.S. citizens died while traveling to the Dominican Republic. The number was 17 in 2017.

Authorities have 10 people in custody related to the shooting and are looking for at least two others.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Dozens of members of the <a href=# rel=noopener>Central Oklahoma Parrothead Association</a>, a group for fans of Jimmy Buffet and trop rock, say they fell “seriously ill” days into their stay at the Hotel Riu Palace Macao in Punta Cana in April.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Dana Flowers, a member and the travel agent, tells TIME that 47 of the 114 members traveling with the group got sick almost immediately, including him.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“It was as bad as it gets,” he says.”Three days in we started noticing people did not make it to concerts and events, it was then we realized they were all sick.

The warning advises travelers exercise increased caution due to violent crime in the country, which include armed robbery, homicide and sexual assault. The State Department says that resort areas tend to be better policed and safer that urban areas for travelers.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Bradley, the <a href=# rel=noopener>International SOS</a> analyst, says there is likely a reasonable explanation for the spate of tourist deaths.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><i><br></i>“It’s the mystery around the deaths that is driving the speculation,” he tells TIME. “American tourists pass away frequently around the world, several in a day, it’s not unusual. But it is unusual hearing about Americans passing away abroad without it being something like a terrorist attack. We usually don’t hear about tourists dying of heart attacks or in their sleep, but that happens everyday with tourist traveling abroad, it is nothing unique to the Dominican Republic.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">He says prospective travelers who are concerned about the recent deaths, should make sure they have a plan for what to do if they get ill. Bradley suggests travelers should have the phone number for the best nearby hospitals and should check with their insurance providers to make sure they will be covered while traveling. He says travelers can ask hotels whether they offer on-site medical assistance. Travelers can also make arrangements to get immediate medical care back home if they have to leave unexpectedly.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><i><br></i>“I don’t think people should distrust Dominican officials,” he adds. “They’re working with what they have. Like they said, 2 million Americans visit DR (Dominican Republic) every year and only a handful have died.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Bradley says he would advise anyone worried about traveling to the Dominican Republic to take the same precautions they would when going anywhere else.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“These incidents, while recent, in my mind don’t indicate Dominican Republic is any less safe than it was before,” Bradley says. “I would tell people to continue with trips.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Considering the level two safety ranking from the State Department, Bradley advises travelers not to go anywhere alone, especially at night. And if you do wander on your own, Bradley says<strong>,</strong> let a companion know when you plan on returning so they can be aware something is amiss if you do not return. “Travel has risk,” Bradley says. “People should be aware before they travel where they are going and plan accordingly, if they do, they usually travel safely.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b></b>Dr. Robert Quigley, Senior Vice President and Regional Medical Director of <a href=# rel=noopener>International SOS</a> says travelers should take extra precaution with their health when away from home.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">He advises travelers to visit a doctor prior to embarking on their trip, especially if they might have a chronic medical condition or cardiovascular disease. Quigley says sleep deprivation and stress can “exacerbate underlying, and sometimes asymptomatic, serious cardiovascular diseases.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">He also advised travelers to pack extra medication in case their trip home is delayed.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Will tourism in the Dominican Republic be affected?</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As the stories continue to emerge, some travelers have taken to social media to voice concerns about traveling to the Caribbean country. While officials at the Dominican Ministry of Tourism told TIME they were not able to elaborate on the situation because of the ongoing investigation, Francisco Javier García, the Minister of Tourism for Dominican Republic said that the investigations are not affecting the number of tourist visiting the country.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“These cases are very regrettable, but isolated.” he said at a press conference in June. “Investigation into them is a top priority for us and for the National Police. We are asking them to deploy all resources to help provide answers as quickly as possible.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">He called the Dominican Republic a “tranquil, peaceful destination and the safest in the region,” and said tourists can “be assured that the authorities are working hard to clarify these incidents.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Despite the reassurance, some travelers are saying the incidents have cast doubt on the safety of the country and are refusing to take a chance.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Until the Dominican Republic can pinpoint what is happening to tourist in their country, please stay out of the DR.
