The tree showed Daemon a rapid-fire series of visions, several of which linked directly to Game of Thrones-era Westeros. He saw flashes of a young, blond Three-Eyed Raven—lending credibility to the <a href=#>popular fan theory</a> that <a href=#>Bran Stark's</a> greenseer mentor was none other than future Targaryen bastard Brynden Rivers—the White Walkers, and, most notably, Daenerys Targaryen the morning after her three dragons hatched.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Daemon seeing Daenerys seemed to confirm that it was in fact the Mother of Dragons, not Jon Snow, who was the Prince That Was Promised. This was a <a href=#>point of contention</a> in Game of Thrones, as Jon was also a Targaryen and led the charge in rallying the army of the living against the White Walkers. Not to mention that Arya Stark ended up being the one to <a href=#>kill the Night King</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">However, House of the Dragon has placed a lot of emphasis on the idea that the reason the Targaryens need to hold the Iron Throne is to one day unite the realm against a terrible threat that Aegon the Conquerer witnessed in a prophetic dream. In the show's very first episode, Viserys (Paddy Considine) <a href=#>passed down his knowledge of Aegon's dream to Rhaenyra</a> after naming her his heir—just as his predecessor, King Jaehaerys, passed it down to him and Rhaenyra passed it to Jace (Harry Collett).</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More: </strong><a href=#>15 Questions House of the Dragon Needs to Answer in Season 3</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">"Aegon foresaw the end of the world of men," Viserys told her. "It is to begin with a terrible winter gusting out of the distant North. Aegon saw absolute darkness riding on those winds, and whatever dwells within will destroy the world of the living. When this great winter comes, Rhaenyra, all of Westeros must stand against it. And if the world of men is to survive, a Targaryen must be seated on the Iron Throne, a king or queen strong enough to unite the realm against the cold and the dark. Aegon called his dream the Song of Ice and Fire. This secret has been passed from king to heir since Aegon’s time. And now you must promise to carry it and protect it."</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As we know from Game of Thrones, Daenerys never actually got the chance to sit the Iron Throne. But it was her decision to walk into the flames of Khal Drago's funeral pyre that brought dragons back into the world and gave the living a fighting chance against the army of the dead. Daenerys being the Prince That Was Promised would also make <a href=#>her fire immunity</a> make more sense, as that was a power that no other Targaryen ever possessed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/gayle-rankin-matt-smith.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">We know from Rhaenyra and Daemon's fight in the Season 1 finale of House of the Dragon that Viserys never told Daemon about the Song of Ice and Fire during the years that Daemon was considered his de facto heir. And when Rhaenyra alerted him to his brother's lack of trust in him, he reacted by violently choking her.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">"My brother was a slave to his omens and portents," he told her. "Anything to make his feckless reign appear to have purpose. Dreams didn't make us kings. Dragons did."</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=#>The House of the Dragon Season 2 Finale Gave Us Something Better Than a Big Battle</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Now, it seems that Daemon has been convinced of the truth of the prophecy and the role he must play in supporting Rhaenyra to eventually bring it about. When Rhaenyra comes to Harrenhal to confront Daemon about the mutiny she suspects he is planning against her, he pledges her alliegance to her. Daemon tells Rhaenyra that he saw the Song of Ice and Fire vision and the coming White Walker threat. Only Rhaenyra, he says, can lead them into the future where a hero saves Westeros from peril.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">When Alys (Gayle Rankin) told Daemon that he would "die in this place" in that first Harrenhal vision, she was right, in a sense. It just turned out to be more of an ego death than a literal one.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZwaGBrfXp9jqGmrquVYrynedOhnGacopa0sLqMnZiepZ%2BjeqWtxKecq7GjYsOqv8iopWarlZbAsLqMa2SfoZ6WuaZ7</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhouse-of-the-dragon-daemon-daenerys-vision-season-2-finale.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhouse-of-the-dragon-daemon-daenerys-vision-season-2-finale.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhouse-of-the-dragon-daemon-daenerys-vision-season-2-finale.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhouse-of-the-dragon-daemon-daenerys-vision-season-2-finale.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhouse-of-the-dragon-daemon-daenerys-vision-season-2-finale.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhouse-of-the-dragon-daemon-daenerys-vision-season-2-finale.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./the-voice-season-15-blind-auditions-part-5-recap.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./the-voice-season-15-blind-auditions-part-5-recap.html>'The Voice' Season 15 Blind Auditions, Part 5 Recap</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./47780-what-counts-as-smart-casual-for-mens-and-womens-attire.html>What counts as smart casual for mens and womens attire?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./47780-what-counts-as-smart-casual-for-mens-and-womens-attire.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
