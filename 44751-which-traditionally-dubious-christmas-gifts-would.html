A third, however, would still be pleased (34%).</p><p>A juicy orange is a common addition to the Christmas stocking for some – but the British public is divided over whether receiving one as a gift would make them happy or not.</p><p>More than four in ten people who celebrate Christmas (43%) would be happy with the citrus treat as a gift, but they’re slightly outweighed by the 48% who would be unhappy.</p><p>Of all the gifts on YouGov’s list, the orange and the hanky are the only ones likely to make recipients more unhappy than happy.</p><h3>Women more likely to be happy with their traditional Christmas gifts than men</h3><p>Generally, women say they would be more pleased than men with the majority of gifts on YouGov’s Christmas list.</p><p>But between the genders, scented candles are most divisive – 48% of men who celebrate Christmas would be happy to unwrap one, compared to 78% of women.</p><p>The gifts men would be more thrilled with than women are multi-packs of underpants (69%-56% among people of each gender who celebrate Christmas), a handkerchief (38%-30%) and an orange (47%-42%).</p><h3>Slippers beat socks as people enter middle age</h3><p>The happiness a jumper can bring as a Christmas present pervades across the generations, topping the poll as the gift most likely to make recipients happy across all age groups, from 85% of those 65 and over to 89% of 18 to 24-year-olds.</p><p>Aside from the jumper, preference for either slippers or socks is next highest, depending on the age of the recipient.</p><p>Your best bet for younger people would be socks – of those who celebrate, 83% of 18 to 24-year-olds and the same proportion of 25 to 49-year-olds say they’d be happy to receive a pair.</p><p>But the appeal of comfy slippers beats socks as people become middle age, with 82% of 50 to 64-year-olds and 80% of the over-65s saying they’d be happy with slippers as a Christmas gift.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkwLCvyJ6rsmeRp8Gqr8ueqmhsZGyCcnnWoaCcoF2pv6KwyK2gqKaRobm6ecOumaKnpah6pLTRoqqtpZGoeqi1xa2qZq%2BfqrmleQ%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f44751-which-traditionally-dubious-christmas-gifts-would.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f44751-which-traditionally-dubious-christmas-gifts-would.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f44751-which-traditionally-dubious-christmas-gifts-would.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f44751-which-traditionally-dubious-christmas-gifts-would.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f44751-which-traditionally-dubious-christmas-gifts-would.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f44751-which-traditionally-dubious-christmas-gifts-would.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./15-real-life-stories-with-hard-to-believe-plot-twists-819723.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./15-real-life-stories-with-hard-to-believe-plot-twists-819723.html>15 Real-Life Stories With Hard-to-Believe Plot Twists</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./bombings-of-america-burrough.html>Terrorist Bombings: America in the 1970s</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./bombings-of-america-burrough.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
