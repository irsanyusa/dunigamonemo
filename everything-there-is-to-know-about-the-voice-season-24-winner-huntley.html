With a raspy charm and undeniable talent, Huntley’s journey to victory was one of dedication, family, and chasing dreams. Dive into his story and discover what makes this Florida-born, Virginia-raised artist the latest champion of the singing competition.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-is-huntley>Who is Huntley?</h2><p>Michael Huntley, coached by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Niall Horan</a>, won The Voice Season 24. His consistent, smooth voice, and his daughter during his Blind Audition won the hearts of the American audience. He beat out finalists Lila Forde, Jacquie Roar, Mara Justine, and Ruby Leigh to take home the title. This marks the second win in a row for Coach Horan.</p><p>Although he originally hails from Spring Hill, Florida, Huntley introduced himself as being from Fredericksburg, Virginia — which is where he and his family live now.</p><p>He began singing at the age of four, when he would impersonate Elvis Presley and sing songs. However, he said in his NBC biography that he didn’t take singing seriously until he was 14 years old and a friend told him he had a good voice.</p><p>Midway through college, he moved to Nashville to pursue a music career, but didn’t find much luck and retreated from the industry. After spending time with his children and working as a booking agent for other musicians, Huntley made the decision to pursue his own singing career again.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-huntley-is-a-proud-father-of-two>Huntley is a Proud Father of Two</h2><p>He has two kids: Stella, who was six when her dad auditioned for The Voice, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Huntley</a>, who was born in 2021. Huntley is not married but, according to sources, he is currently dating a woman named Hannah Cook.</p><p>Stella watched Huntley’s Blind Audition from the side of the stage with tears in her eyes, even mouthing some of the words to the song. When the singer turned all four Coaches’ chairs, he asked if he could bring Stella onto the stage as he made his decision of whose team to join.</p><p>“Can I ask you guys a favor?” he asked. “I had a dream that my daughter came on stage, is that OK?”</p><p>The Coaches all agreed and greeted Stella. Horan asked Stella about her opinion of her dad. Stella replied that he was really good. Then, Huntley handed over the microphone to Stella and she announced the pick for Coach Horan.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-huntley-auditioned-on-american-idol-twice>Huntley Auditioned on American Idol Twice</h2><p>Before his winning journey on The Voice, Huntley first appeared on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">American Idol</a>. He auditioned for the singing competition twice, and his second attempt was during Season 16. Huntley’s exceptional talent and soulful voice impressed the judges and earned him a Golden Ticket, which sent him straight to Hollywood.</p><p>While Huntley’s journey on American Idol saw him successfully navigate the initial stages, Hollywood Week posed a formidable challenge. Despite his impressive vocal abilities, Huntley did not advance past this stage of the competition during Season 16.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Original_SnoopDogg_Jerod-HarrisGetty-Images-220x147.jpeg alt="Snoop Dogg Announced as Special Correspondent for NBC in The Paris Olympics" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57xK%2Bcq7Gknbavs4ytn56qlWK2tHnTqGSkpp%2BseqKuzq6rZqyYmnq3u8icnGarlZbAsLqMa2tmr5mju6a%2BjKGsp6ycmsZw</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2feverything-there-is-to-know-about-the-voice-season-24-winner-huntley.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2feverything-there-is-to-know-about-the-voice-season-24-winner-huntley.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2feverything-there-is-to-know-about-the-voice-season-24-winner-huntley.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2feverything-there-is-to-know-about-the-voice-season-24-winner-huntley.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2feverything-there-is-to-know-about-the-voice-season-24-winner-huntley.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2feverything-there-is-to-know-about-the-voice-season-24-winner-huntley.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./how-15-celebs-looked-before-they-found-their-iconic-hairstyles-801265.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./how-15-celebs-looked-before-they-found-their-iconic-hairstyles-801265.html>How 15 Celebs Looked Before They Found Their Iconic Hairstyles</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./tar-aftersun-music-supervisor-lucy-bright-classical-score-songs-cate-blanchett-1235442739.html>Behind the Music of Tr and Aftersun: Music Supervisor Lucy Bright on Cate Blanch</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./tar-aftersun-music-supervisor-lucy-bright-classical-score-songs-cate-blanchett-1235442739.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
