However, we’ve been known to keep some of our favorite flannels in rotation even through spring. Flannel fabric is often found in fun, seasonal prints, though you can buy them in solids. As we head into fall and winter, flannel sheets are a great choice for most sleepers. You can find flannel sheets for nearly every size of bed (and even cribs and dog beds!), so everyone in your family can enjoy them.</p><h2 id=what-to-consider-when-buying-flannel-sheets->What to consider when buying flannel sheets</h2><h3>What is the sheet made of?</h3><p>Most flannel sheets are made from 100% cotton, but you can find them mixed with wool, polyester, or other materials. Good flannel sheets should be moisture-wicking, soft, and breathable. Flannel gets its soft, slightly fuzzy texture due to a process called napping, which is why cotton flannel is known for its extra cozy feeling. Making it a highly popular choice for sheets, especially when the sheets are 100% cotton versus a mix of fibers. Unlike the <a rel=alternate href=#>percale</a> or <a rel=alternate href=#>linen bed sheets</a>, the quality of flannel sheets isn’t measured in thread counts but in the weight of grams per square meter of the bed sheet (GSM). So, if you are looking for a flannel good enough to last several seasons, look for a rating of 170 GSM or higher when shopping for these sheets.</p><h3>How does it feel?</h3><p>Brushed flannel is usually extremely soft and slightly fuzzy to the touch. Flannel is a warmer material than, say, the best Supima cotton sheets or the <a rel=alternate href=#>best bamboo sheets</a>, making it ideal for cooler and colder temperatures.</p><h3>How long will it last?</h3><p>Flannel sheets are known for longevity; if you care for them properly, they can last up to a decade. Flannel will pill over time though, depending on care and quality, which may impact how long you want to keep them.</p><h3>How heavy is the sheet?</h3><p>A high-quality flannel sheet will often have a 170 GSM measurement or higher, which will impact the weight of the sheet.</p><h3>Do I like prints and patterns?</h3><p>Flannel sheets are often designed in prints like tartan plaids and buffalo checks, including fall and winter images, such as leaves, evergreens, skis, and snow. If you want a holiday-themed sheet, you can find flannel designed for Halloween, Christmas, Hanukkah, and even Thanksgiving!</p><h2 id=our-top-picks-for-the-best-flannel-sheets>Our top picks for the best flannel sheets</h2><h3>Best flannel sheets on Amazon: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Eddie Bauer - Flannel Collection - Cotton Bedding Sheet Set</a></h3><p>Maine-based Eddie Bauer makes high-quality cotton flannel, and if you don’t want to wait for your sheets to arrive, it also has a shop on Amazon. I love the 21 pattern choices in various clever and cute patterns, like evergreen trees, schools of fish, retrievers wearing holiday garb, and more. I’ve found that these sheets get softer over time with every wash, and with so many pattern choices (21, in sizes from twin to king), it's easy to find a pair for my household and family members on my holiday list.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Materials: 100% cotton</li><li>GSM: N/A, but brushed three times</li><li>Sizes available: Twin to king</li><li>Price on publish: $49</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Affordable flannel sheets</li><li>21 prints</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>May pill over time</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>These affordable flannel sheets come in a wide variety of patterns and prints, including many kid-friendly and seasonal choices, and are brushed three times for extra softness.</p><p><span class=best-for>Best flannel sheets on Amazon</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Eddie Bauer 100% Cotton Flannel Novelty Prints Sheet Set</h3></p><h3>Best affordable flannel sheets: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Bliss Casa 4 Piece 100% Cotton Flannel Sheet Set Queen</a></h3><p>Another Amazon offering, these sheets have over 2,7000 reviews (most positive), extolling these sheets’ softness and affordability. Choose from 11 patterns, from buffalo check to sweet purple flowers, and sizes go up to a king. They have a GSM of 150, which makes them a solid pick for cozy bedding at a budget-friendly price.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Materials: Cotton</li><li>GSM: 150</li><li>Sizes available: Twin to king</li><li>Price on publish: $34.99</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Affordable</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Less than 170 GSM</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>If you need an affordable flannel sheet set in a limited, but attractive range of prints, this set is a good choice, especially if you need multiple sets.</p><p><span class=best-for>Best affordable flannel sheets</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Bliss Casa 4 Piece 100% Cotton Flannel Sheet Set Queen</h3></p><h3>Best organic flannel sheets: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Boll & Branch Flannel Solid Sheet Set</a></h3><p>This set of high-quality cotton flannel sheets is also a splurge, but these won best organic flannel. Its eco-friendly maker, Boll & Branch sells products made from GOTS Certified Organic Cotton and also certified STANDARD 100 by OEKO-TEX, like this luxurious set of flannel sheets made in Portugal. This cozy bedding only comes in three neutral colors, but the sizes go up to a California king. The extreme comfort factor, plus knowing you’re sleeping on chemical-free flannel sheets that feel cozy and keep you warm, may be worth skipping your search for buffalo checks and seasonal plaids.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Materials: 100% organic cotton</li><li>GSM: N/A</li><li>Sizes available: Twin to California king</li><li>Price on publish: $249 (Twin)</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Organic certified cotton</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Only three color offerings</li><li>Expensive</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>If you can afford a high-end, luxury flannel sheet and don’t need seasonal prints, this set from Boll & Branch is soft and warm, brushed, triple-sheared, and certified organic.</p><p><span class=best-for>Best affordable flannel sheets</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Bliss Casa 4 Piece 100% Cotton Flannel Sheet Set Queen</h3></p><h3>Best splurge flannel sheets: <a rel=nofollow href=#>L.L. Bean Premium Supima Flannel Sheet Collection</a></h3><p>L.L.Bean (another Maine-based brand) understands the importance of creating high-quality, long-lasting, and built-for-warmth products, and their flannel sheets are no exception. These sets are on the splurgy side but oh-so worth the investment. Generously sized with deep pockets so they don’t pull off the bed, these sheets are made with 100% Portuguese cotton that creates some of the softest flannel. These sheets feel heavier in hand than a few of our other offerings, which is a testament to the construction of the fabric. (You can also buy matching cases to keep your <a rel=alternate href=#>best pillows</a> looking their best.) Like most products from L.L.Bean, these are built to last several years (or even decades).</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Materials: 100% Supima® cotton flannel</li><li>GSM: N/A (6 oz. per square yard, which equals over 200 GSM)</li><li>Sizes available: Twin to king</li><li>Price on publish: $199 (full)</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Extremely durable</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>No seasonal prints</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>L.L.

These sheets come in eight colors, but the pumpkin shade is great for fall.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Materials: 100% cotton flannel</li><li>GSM: N/A</li><li>Sizes available: Twin to California king</li><li>Price on publish: $33.99</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Affordable</li><li>Deep pockets for an easy fit</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Not as many prints or color options</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>This is a great option for buying multiple sets of brushed flannel sheets because of the price point.</p><p><span class=best-for>Best breathable flannel sheets</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Wayfair Basics® Bruck Standard Cotton Flannel Sheet Set</h3></p><h3>Best lightweight flannel sheets: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Brooklinen Brushed Flannel Core Sheet Set</a></h3><p>These brushed flannel core sheets are soft enough to snuggle into but lightweight and breathable for sleepers who don’t like to overheat at night. Brooklinen was founded by two industry experts with a goal of making responsibly-manufactured premium bedding accessible, so you know the quality will be good. (Brooklinen also made our list of the best places to buy bedding.) The patterns and color palette are limited to soft plaids and speckles that are easy to mix and match with the brand’s duvets and comforters and fit up to a California king bed.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Materials: 100% cotton flannel</li><li>GSM: N/A</li><li>Sizes available: Twin to California King</li><li>Price on publish: $143.65 (Twin)</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Chemical-free sheets</li><li>Super soft</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Expensive</li><li>Limited designs/colors</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>Brooklinen makes beautiful and comfortable flannel sheets.

Deep pockets (fits mattresses up to 18 inches deep) and luxury flannel are a great duo anytime, especially since 100% cotton flannel may sometimes shrink (depending on the brand) after a few washes. This deep pocket means it goes on without fuss, and its weight will keep you warm all winter. The best part is it still fits even after a few washes. While this deep pocket fitted sheet isn’t part of a set, The Company Store sells corresponding flannel flat sheets and pillowcases to create your own bedding set. Note: The deep pocket sizes are only available in queen, king, and California king sizes only.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Materials: 100% cotton flannel</li><li>GSM: N/A</li><li>Sizes available: Queen, king and California king</li><li>Price on publish: $99.50 (deep pocket Queen)</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Deep pocket</li><li>All-around elastic on sheet</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>The deep pocket design doesn’t come in twin or full</li><li>It may be costly for one sheet</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>This is a deep-pocket bottom sheet made in Portugal from 100% cotton flannel that is cozy and comfortable and, best of all, won’t slip off in the night.</p><p><span class=best-for>Best deep pocket flannel sheets</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Luxe Ultra-Cozy Cotton Flannel Deep Pocket Fitted Bed Sheet - Slate Blue, Size Deep Pocket Queen | The Company Store</h3></p><h3>Best heavyweight flannel sheets: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Peacock Alley Egyptian Cotton Flannel Sheet Set</a></h3><p>When searching for heavyweight flannel sheets, you want to look for a high GSM count, and with 200 GSM, these high-end sheets will definitely keep you feeling weighted with warmth. Made from Egyptian cotton that’s lightly brushed, these sheets may not feel as soft as some flannels, but its weight will rival those with a lower GSM. These are expensive, so before you buy, make sure whoever receives these flannels is searching for extremely warm flannel.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Materials: 100% Egyptian cotton</li><li>GSM: 200</li><li>Sizes available: Twin to California king</li><li>Price on publish: $170 (Twin)</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Made from Egyptian cotton</li><li>High GSM</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>It may not be as soft as some flannels due to the heavy weight of the flannel.</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>These heavy-weight flannel sheets from 100% Egyptian cotton will keep you warm in bed this winter.</p><p><span class=best-for>Best heavyweight flannel sheets</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Peacock Alley Egyptian Cotton Flannel Sheet Set</h3></p><h3>Best patterned flannel sheets: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Garnet Hill Mini-Print Flannel Sheets</a></h3><p>My family and I love these OEKO-TEX® STANDARD 100 Certified patterned flannel sheets because they provide just enough warmth without overpowering. The prints for flannels are seasonal for winter nights (think stars, skis, trees, and snowflakes). While the price point is slightly higher than some brands, Garnet Hill’s quality means you won’t have to replace these sheets often unless you want to buy a few new prints to keep things merry and bright during the holidays. If you don’t want mini prints, Garnett Hill carries a wide selection of pretty patterned flannel sheets like its <a rel=nofollow href=#>Nordic Forest</a> and <a rel=nofollow href=#>Woodland Winter</a> wonderland patterned flannel and other beautifully illustrated printed flannel sheets.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Materials: 100% cotton flannel</li><li>GSM: N/A</li><li>Sizes available: Twin to California king</li><li>Price on publish: $109 (Twin)</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Hand-painted clever and cute patterns</li><li>Don’t pill easily</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>If you love seasonal bedding, you’ll adore the whimsical flannel sheets based on hand painted artwork. These flannels will keep you warm and snug in bed and don’t pill easily, meaning you can enjoy them season after season.</p><p><span class=best-for>Best patterned flannel sheets</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Garnet Hill Mini-Print Flannel Sheets</h3></p><h2 id=how-we-selected-the-best-flannel-sheets>How we selected the best flannel sheets</h2><p>To find the best sets of flannel sheets for all budgets and styles, we slept on many sets, researched what makes a great flannel sheet, asked our friends and colleagues what they loved best, and delved into customer reviews, while comparing price points and manufacturing processes for the coziest and cutest flannel sheets. The best offerings below include (mostly) flannel sheet sets versus a single sheet, plus one or two pillowcases, depending on the brand.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>Are flannel sheets worth it?</h3><p>If you like cozy and soft sheets to keep you warm, flannel sheets can be a welcome addition to cold-weather bedding.</p><h3>Is flannel good for sheets?</h3><p>Yes. Cotton flannel is a great material for sheets due to its comfort, softness, and, often, affordability.</p><h3>Should you put flannel sheets in the dryer?</h3><p>Yes, you can put flannel sheets in the dryer, but consider air drying if possible and always tumble dry on low. Also, if you are wondering about <a rel=alternate href=#>how often you should wash your sheets</a>, flannels, like most sheets, should be cleaned approximately every two weeks, and more often, if you sleep with a pet, suffer from night sweats, or live in a warmer climate—in which case you may not want flannel sheets anyway.</p><h3>Should hot sleepers avoid flannel sheets?</h3><p>If your body temperature runs hot at night or you tend to get night sweats, you may want to consider silk, percale, or Supima cotton sheets instead of flannel.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1llqGur7rEpWSsoJWawbR7</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbest-flannel-sheets.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbest-flannel-sheets.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbest-flannel-sheets.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbest-flannel-sheets.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbest-flannel-sheets.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbest-flannel-sheets.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./photo-of-the-day-gideon-okeke-linda-ejiofor-help-abused-women-children.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./photo-of-the-day-gideon-okeke-linda-ejiofor-help-abused-women-children.html>Gideon Okeke, Linda Ejiofor help abused women, children</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./15-effective-ways-to-soothe-an-upset-baby-443760.html>15Effective Ways toSoothe anUpset Baby</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./15-effective-ways-to-soothe-an-upset-baby-443760.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
