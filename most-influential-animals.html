The Animals 100 board consisted of PETA president Ingrid Newkirk, Animal Planet and Discovery Channel president Rich Ross, environmentalist Philippe Cousteau, Farm Sanctuary president Gene Baur, BuzzFeed Animals editor Chelsea Marshall, my friend Phil Johnston—who not only co-wrote Zootopia but also wrote the scene in The Brothers Grimsby in which the characters get stuck in an elephant’s vagina—and Moby, the vegan musician who lives a few houses away from me and was walking by my driveway while I was working on this. (Read about the <a href=# rel=noopener>totally rigorous process here</a>.)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Here’s the full list:</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Correction</strong>: The original version of this story misstated the year Jaws was released.

After the public shaming of the dentist, which included Jimmy Kimmel crying on air, it became clear that big game hunting was no longer socially acceptable. Within a few months, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service added two subspecies of lion to the endangered list making hunting of them not okay for U.S. citizens. France banned importing dead lion trophies. And more than 40 airlines will not transport them. Plus, Jimmy Kimmel cried.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">2.

After killing three people, getting his own documentary and more impressively inspiring Tommy Lee to write a letter, the park is ending its orca shows. SeaWorld’s stock price plummeted. “He got everyone to open their eyes. We got Southwest to take orcas off their planes. We got Mattel to stop making a SeaWorld Barbie. He was the follow up to Free Willie: ‘Free Tillie.’” In March it was discovered that Tilikum now has a fatal respiratory disease that Newkirk blames SeaWorld for and SeaWorld blames respiratory disease on.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">3.

Ten Chinese CRISPR goats</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Using the American-created CRISPR technology that allows scientist to snip and move parts of DNA, Lei Qu at the Shaanxi Provincial Engineering and Technology Research Center for Shaanbei Cashmere Goats—which is a real place—created goats (presumably Shaanbei Cashmere ones) with bigger muscles and longer hair, to increase their meat and wool. Americans invented CRISPR technology, but they won’t use it because they’re ethical wimps. The Chinese have made super beagles, super pigs, super sheep, super monkeys and—this last one is totally a guess—that eagle that attacked Donald Trump.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">5. <i>Revenant</i> Bear</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/time-100-influential-animals-joel-stein_05-revenant-bear.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Didn’t see the movie, but if TIME can put Leonardo DiCaprio on its <a href=#>TIME 100 list</a>, I can totally put the bear from that movie on the list. Even if there was no actual bear rape in the movie, Revenant Bear brought up the issue of bear rape.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">6. Pizza Rat</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/time-100-influential-animals-joel-stein_06-pizza-rat.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The scrappy spirit of New York City was captured by the video of this rat trying to carry a whole, uneaten slice of pizza down some subway stairs.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">7.

But they’re not quite a species either, since it’s just the mosquitoes that carry the disease we’re talking about. I can’t believe I spent so much time thinking about this.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">8. Mickey Mouse</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/time-100-influential-animals-joel-stein_08-mickey-mouse.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Do I need to explain this? Really? It’s Mickey Mouse. He’s the Warren Buffet of animals. He’s worth $160 billion. You show a photo of Mickey Mouse to anyone in the world, you know what they say? They say, “Mickey Mouse!” You show a photo of TIME 100 cosmologist Kip Thorne to anyone in the world and you know what they say? “Show me Mickey Mouse again!”</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">9.

Remember? The horse? Who won the three races? With the owners who couldn’t spell “pharaoh”? Yeah, I know it’s not 1940. That’s why it’s all the way down here on the list.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">10. Angry Birds</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/time-100-influential-animals-joel-stein_10-angry-birds.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">An $80 million Angry Birds movie comes out May 20. And they’re still angry? These are the luckiest birds in history.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">11. Naruto</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/time-100-influential-animals-joel-stein_11-naruto.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The macaque, which is one of an apparently endless number of words for “monkey,” took selfies as part of nature-photographer David Slater’s project in Indonesia. PETA sued Slater, saying he can’t make money off the picture, since the monkey owns the copyright. Shockingly, the court case wasn’t about whether photography really is art, but about whether animals have the same rights as humans. A judge in (surprise!) Northern California had to rule on Naruto, et al. v. Slater, et al. deciding that a monkey isn’t a person.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">12. Grecia</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/time-100-influential-animals-joel-stein_12-grecia.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Some teenagers (I’m just assuming it was teenagers) in Costa Rica took a block of wood and smashed a toucan’s beak off. People raised $5,000 in two days on crowdfunding site Indiegogo to create a 3D-printed beak so Grecia could eat again. Which is a really sweet image until you find out that toucans eat maggots.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">13. Tieta</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/time-100-influential-animals-joel-stein_13-tieta.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This is hard to believe, but around the same time the Costa Ricans were 3D-printing a beak for Grecia, the Brazilians were 3D-printing a beak for their own injured toucan, Tieta. This is way less important that the Costa Rican incident which got all the rich Costa Rican tourists upset and into wildlife. But if we spread Grecia and Tieta apart on the list, you would have already forgotten about Grecia, so this seemed easier for everybody.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">14. Freeway llamas</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/time-100-influential-animals-joel-stein_14-freeway-llamas.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The O.J. Simpson-style chase of one black and one white llama was covered live for 20 minutes on local Arizona television, as cops chased the two by car and then by foot, eventually lassoing both. “The llama thing was the day of “the dress,” says Buzzfeed Animals editor Chelsea Marshall, about the garment that was either blue or not blue or something like that. “I ran home with so much energy. There was so much stuff happening on the Internet that day. The llamas would have blown up more if the dress weren’t so crazy.”</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">15. Lolita the Orca</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/time-100-influential-animals-joel-stein_15-lolita-the-orca.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Hundreds of protestors showed up at the Miami Seaquarium on January 17 to protest the orca that’s not only been held in captivity since 1970, but also given a super-creepy name. Lolita is the subject of a court case over whether an endangered species is exempt from being forced to put on a mildly entertaining show.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">16. Diesel</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/time-100-influential-animals-joel-stein_16-diesel.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The seven-year-old Belgian Shepherd busted into the apartment of the guy suspected of planning the Paris bombings, took multiple gunshot wounds and died. The police dog saved the life of the Paris police, posthumously receiving the Dickin Medal, which sounds much better with a French accent. The Twitter hashtag #JeSuisChien trended on Twitter.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">17. Sudan</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/time-100-influential-animals-joel-stein_17-sudan.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The last male Northern White Rhinoceros in the world, Sudan is living in Kenya’s Ol Pejeta Conservancy where he is encouraged to breed with two young female Northern White Rhinos, Fatu and Najin. IVF is being considered. To prevent poaching, he has 24-hour armed guards, watchtowers, drones, guard dogs and transmitters in his horn. He has been visited by Bollywood actress Nargis Fakhri, and still was not turned on enough to mate successfully with either of his brides.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">18.

This will inspire all impossibly long-named German shorthaired pointers to cut their hair or wash or whatever is required to win this thing.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">19. Cow that gave stem cells for in-vitro meat burger</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Thanks to the stem cell donations of one anonymous cow, people are making fake beef, which might one day save the environment and cows. It could also get the far right angry about cow abortions despite the fact that they don’t exist.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">20. Piper, Barack, PT, Angelica, Shirley, Romeo and many other Ringling Brothers Elephants Whose Names I Didn’t Feel Like Looking Up</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/time-100-influential-animals-joel-stein_20-elephants-circus.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">They’re being retired, as the circus is deciding to go elephant-free because people thought that it was pretty mean to make elephants do stuff even though, for the rest of us, it means more stage time for clowns.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">21. Grumpy Cat</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/time-100-influential-animals-joel-stein_21-grumpy-cat.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Though her real name is Tardar Sauce (trivia: Tardar Sauce was named after tartar sauce) this cat has feline dwarfism and an underbite, which makes it look grumpy. Its Facebook page has more than 8 million Likes. It’s been on the cover of New York magazine. It has it’s own wax statue at Madame Tussauds. It starred in a Honey Nut Cheerios commercial. Showing amazing range, it’s appeared on The Bachelorette and WWE’s Monday Night Raw. It’s been to TIME magazine for a <a href=#>photo shoot</a>. As the Official Spokescat of Friskies, it was flown first class to New York, where it got a hotel room with its own king-size bed and a personal assistant. It was voiced by Aubrey Plaza for a Lifetime movie called Grumpy Cat’s Worst Christmas Ever. All of this is true.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">22. Suraj</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/time-100-influential-animals-joel-stein_22-suraj.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">One of about 600 Hindu temple elephants that are kept chained in confinement most of the year to be paraded in a religious procession, Suraj had lost an ear from abuse. (This, in any case, according to the Daily Mail.) He was freed from the 12-square-foot room he had lived in for 20 years by the kind of people who free animals, which caused a riot from the temple-goers. But the episode is also causing India to reconsider whether elephants should be employed this way.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">23. Qiaoqiao</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In February, someone in Beijing stole Tian Fengbo’s dog, which is one of the very, very few seeing-eye dogs (apparently there are only about 100) in all of China. Tian is a masseur, which is a common job for Chinese blind people, and he owns a chain of massage parlors. After a media uproar, Qiaoqiao was returned by the thieves with a note of apology.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">24. Bei Bei</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/time-100-influential-animals-joel-stein_24-bei-bei2.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Born in August in the National Zoo in Washington D.C., Bei Bei is one of those thin diplomatic lines of connection between the U.S. and China. Apparently, the Chinese have long conducted most of their diplomacy by giving pandas to other countries, dating back to the seventh century (which is the ones that start with “6” and not “7”). First ladies Michelle Obama and Peng Liyuan had to agree on its name. The zoo offered Ping Ping (“peace”) while China liked Bei Bei (which I’m pretty sure means “Beyoncé Beyoncé”.) When Bei Bei turns four, he has to move to China. Until then, you can watch him on the zoo’s PandaCam.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">25. Shark that attacked Mick Fanning</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/time-100-influential-animals-joel-stein_25-shark-mick-fanning1.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The J-Bay Open, an event on the World Surf League Championship Tour ended prematurely when a shark attacked surfer Mike Fanning. It chewed off the leash of his surfboard before he punched it in the back and got picked up by a rescue boat. And it was all on live TV. Fanning and Julian Wilson decided to take a tie for first place instead of getting back in the water. I’m assuming they just do that for the rest of their lives.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">26. Kabosu</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/time-100-influential-animals-joel-stein_26-kobasu1.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The original Shiba Inu that started the “doge” meme in which people who are bored on the Internet try to help other people who are bored on the Internet. It inspired Dogecoin, which is a currency specifically created for people who think Bitcoin is too popular. NASCAR driver Josh Wise’s car was sponsored by Dogecoin. So wow.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">27.

In 2005, China gifted these two pandas to Taiwan as part of its panda diplomacy. “Tuan Yuan” means reunion, which would sound ominous to me if I were Taiwan, but apparently isn’t so bad that it would keep them from taking free pandas. In return, Taiwan sent China two Formosan Sika deer and two Taiwan Serows. Which seems a little lame. It’s not like anyone is talking about Serow diplomacy.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">29.

There was a stray Calico cat named Nama, who was adopted by this failing little train station in some remote city in Japan. She was so beloved, She was made the station master of the Kishi stop, which crucially included wearing a tiny conductor hat. Tama reportedly increased passengers by over 10 percent, bringing in an estimated 1.1 billion yen ($10 million), and saving the station and the company that ran the line. Eventually Tama was made the first feline executive of a train station company. Tama died last year. Her funeral was attended by 3,000 people and a bronze statue was built at the station. After the 50 days of mourning in Shinto tradition, the Calico that trained under Tama, Nitama (which means “second Tama”) was named stationmaster. Nitama studied under Tama, apprenticed by running the Idakiso Station and attended Cat Stationmaster Training School.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">38.

Which would be wrong!</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">97. Toast and Finn</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/time-100-influential-animals-joel-stein_97-toast-and-finn.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Remember that guy who called himself “The Fat Jew” who was popular on social media and then people discovered he stole all his jokes from other people on social media and no one bought his book or paid attention to him any more? Well, he came up with a new angle. He threw a wedding for his dog, who married a dog belonging to Amanda Hearst, the heiress to the Hearst fortune. Tickets cost $150 and went to some animal charity. The wedding was attended by 300 people and held at the High Line hotel in Manhattan on January 13. The bride dog wore a custom gown by Marchesa and a $139,000 diamond necklace on loan. She was led down the aisle by Simon Doonan. The wedding was officiated by Cindy Adams who said to the attendees, “Speak now or forever hold your pee.” Drinks were donated by Smirnoff; a specialty cocktail called the Chiweenie-Tini was served. The cake was supplied by Butterfly Bakeshop. Do not let Bernie Sanders read this, or he will instantly turn into fiery coals.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">98.
