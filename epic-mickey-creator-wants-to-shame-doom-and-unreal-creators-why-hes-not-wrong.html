I don’t think luminary’s too strong a label, though his output’s dwindled in recent years. My favorites are still the games he was involved with in the 1990s: Ultima VI: The False Prophet, Ultima Underworld II: Labyrinth of Worlds, Shadowcaster, Wings of Glory, System Shock, Thief: The Dark Project.</p><p>He’s probably best known for&nbsp;Deus Ex, in 2000, though that one&nbsp;never really worked for me. What can I say?&nbsp;System Shock spoiled me.</p><p>(<strong>MORE:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=#>Papo & Yo Review: A Heartbreaking Meditation on Alcoholism and Child Abuse</a>)</p><p>Spector’s been less active in recent years, the exception being&nbsp;Epic Mickey&nbsp;for the Wii in 2011, which <a href=#>earned modest accolades</a>, apparently selling well enough to justify&nbsp;a multiplatform sequel as well as a 3DS spinoff, both due this November.</p><p>The reasons I mention him is this: At Gamescom in Cologne last week, he&nbsp;<a href=#>said some stuff to Eurogamer Germany</a>&nbsp;about the state of gaming and made reference to John Carmack of id Software (Doom, Quake, Rage) and Tim Sweeney of Epic Games (Unreal).&nbsp;The gist: The games industry has violence and boy toys down pat, but it’s been in a creative rut forever.</p><p>“I’ve been actively trying to shame some of my fellow developers, specifically John Carmack and Tim Sweeney,” Spector told EG (<a href=#>Eurogamer’s translation</a>). “Can you imagine what games would look like if those two guys spent as much time working on non-combat AI as they do on rendering? Can you imagine what games we would have if John Carmack decided he wanted to create a believable character as opposed to a believable gun?”</p><p>It’s kind of hard to imagine anyone doing that these days, when,&nbsp;<a href=#>according to GameStop</a>, you find stuff like&nbsp;Call of Duty: Black Ops 2,&nbsp;Borderlands 2,&nbsp;Madden NFL 13&nbsp;and&nbsp;Halo 4&nbsp;topping “most anticipated” lists.&nbsp;That’s what lists like GameStop’s have looked like for as long as I’ve been writing about games: military-football-sci-fi-sequel-shooters. Games that, love ’em or leave ’em, you know were green-lit by publishers because they print money. Games bankrolled by cynical producers with no qualms about pandering to a demographic that’s been stuck in a loop for basically replaying Doom&nbsp;for decades.</p><p>I’m not saying those sorts of games can’t be well made. I admired&nbsp;Halo 3&nbsp;and&nbsp;Madden NFL ’09. I was into&nbsp;World of Warcraft, StarCraft II and <a href=#>Diablo III</a>.&nbsp;I can name at least two enjoyable&nbsp;Call of Duty games, e.g. Call of Duty 2, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. But I’ve always known, playing that stuff, that I was looking more at gaming’s past than its future.</p><p>“Think about what we do,” said Spector. “Think about our controls. We have a controller that has a bunch of buttons on it. That maps really well to, I’m going to press this button at this millisecond which will cause a pixel to move on the screen and create another pixel. We do that really well, and that maps really well to pulling a virtual trigger on a virtual gun. It’s easy for us to do that.”</p><p>Easy to build realistic weapons in games like gas-powered semiautomatic rifles and over-the-shoulder RPGs.&nbsp;Easy to transplant power-fantasy rulesets like those in&nbsp;Dungeons & Dragons to games where you’re some nobody yokel who’s really the savior of the world.&nbsp;Easy to play as an affable swashbuckler in a game like Uncharted, yet&nbsp;callously slaughter hundreds if not thousands over the course of a single game.</p><p>What does it say about us as gamers, that our pinnacle achievement, based on what sells, is that we’ve perfected the art of the power-fantasy kill?</p><p>(<strong>MORE:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=#>The 10 Best New Skyrim Mods for July 2012</a>)</p><p>But then no one’s figured out how to do “believable characters” in games yet, and even if they had, how do you fold “believable” into a game that’s still classifiable as a game? Imagine designing a ruleset to accommodate a Turing-plausible virtual A.I. Imagine coding around that sort of unpredictability. Games depend on a certain amount of authorial control, whether it’s the “you go, I go”&nbsp;ruleset of something like Tic-tac-toe, or the way, even in games as open-ended as Skyrim and Grand Theft Auto IV, that the narrative doesn’t advance unless you do X, Y or Z first.</p><p>At best, doing “believable characters” in games today involves making significant compromises, designers cribbing from other genres (mostly film) to head fake our emotions.</p><p>Like: <a href=#>The deathbed sequence</a> in Hironobu Sakaguchi and Mistwalker’s&nbsp;Lost Odyssey. Or <a href=#>the golf club</a> in Ken Levine and Irrational’s&nbsp;BioShock. Or what happens <a href=#>when you feed Monster frogs</a> in Vander Caballero and Minority’s&nbsp;Papo & Yo. Or most of the story <a href=#>told by David Cage and Quantic Dream in&nbsp;Heavy Rain</a>.</p><p>Even BioShock‘s most famous sequence is totally scripted, remembered if anything more for its clever narrative twist. What’s the difference between watching a character deliver a series of chilling deathblows, say, and reading that same sequence in something like a comic book? (See Scott McCloud’s <a href=#>Understanding Comics</a>, in particular the chapter “Blood in the Gutter.”) What’s the difference between tapping the gamepad a few times to advance the story in a game, and hammering the “play” or “fast forward”&nbsp;button on a TV remote?</p><p>That’s how so much of game design works today. So what if&nbsp;someone with the technical wherewithal of a John Carmack or Tim Sweeney, who — instead of fetishizing photorealistic gaming — turned their attention instead toward crafting better characters and progressing the age old “shoot”/”don’t shoot” or “kick the puppy”/”don’t kick the puppy” problem?</p><p>In 2006, I interviewed Spector for a Computer Gaming World&nbsp;story about artificial intelligence. I think this answer to my question, “How can games better implement non-confrontational/non-violent A.I.?”&nbsp;sums up why we’re still asking questions like this six years later.</p><p>My “thinking” is that our ability to create compelling non-combat A.I. is pretty puny. The issue is creating characters that behave in ways that, given the context of a game or scene, elicit an appropriate emotional response in players. Take the guns away and we lose the most easily elicited emotion — fear — and we’re left with…not a lot. How do we make progress in the non-confrontational space? Beats me — maybe someone in a garage somewhere is solving the problem even as we speak. If I knew how to solve this problem (and it’s a huge problem for gaming — one that is really holding us back as a medium of expression and communication) I’d be making a very different kind of game!</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=#>Dust: An Elysian Tail Is from a Future That Never Happened</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmislZi1ra3NnWWtoZ2ae6S7zGhpaWliZH15e5FpZp6omZh6rrXCpJyyZZOnsqLAzqtksJmeqcBuwM5mqqGZnZp6pbvOpmSappRiwq%2B%2BxJqjZpuimq61u9GsZLCgqWK1pr%2BMp6atZaenvK%2Bzjg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fepic-mickey-creator-wants-to-shame-doom-and-unreal-creators-why-hes-not-wrong.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fepic-mickey-creator-wants-to-shame-doom-and-unreal-creators-why-hes-not-wrong.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fepic-mickey-creator-wants-to-shame-doom-and-unreal-creators-why-hes-not-wrong.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fepic-mickey-creator-wants-to-shame-doom-and-unreal-creators-why-hes-not-wrong.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fepic-mickey-creator-wants-to-shame-doom-and-unreal-creators-why-hes-not-wrong.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fepic-mickey-creator-wants-to-shame-doom-and-unreal-creators-why-hes-not-wrong.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./the-masked-singer-recap-harp-keeps-her-crown-on-vegas-night.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./the-masked-singer-recap-harp-keeps-her-crown-on-vegas-night.html>Harp Keeps Her Crown on Vegas Night</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./droit-de-derogation-accorde-aux-prefets-des-dispenses-ponctuelles-pour-les-collectivites.html>des dispenses ponctuelles pour les collectivits ?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./droit-de-derogation-accorde-aux-prefets-des-dispenses-ponctuelles-pour-les-collectivites.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
