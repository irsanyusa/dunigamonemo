<time>31 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>In&nbsp;numerous countries around the world, toilet <a href=# title=hygiene data-link=tag>hygiene</a> practices diverge significantly from the common use of&nbsp;<a href=# title="toilet paper" data-link=tag>toilet paper</a>. A&nbsp;fascinating example of&nbsp;this can be&nbsp;found in&nbsp;countries such as&nbsp;Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and <a href=# title=India data-link=tag>India</a>, where traditional bathrooms often feature a&nbsp;wide, scoop-like plastic <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>implement</a>, known as&nbsp;a&nbsp;“dipper,” which is&nbsp;utilized for personal hygiene. But that’s not all; in&nbsp;Japan, they’ve taken toilet innovation to&nbsp;a&nbsp;whole new level with the development of&nbsp;specialized toilets featuring cleansing seats that offer an&nbsp;experience akin to&nbsp;a&nbsp;bidet.</p><p>Diving deeper into this intriguing phenomenon, one can’t help but wonder what drives these alternative practices in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Asia data-link=tag>Asia</a>, and it&nbsp;turns out there’s a&nbsp;multitude of&nbsp;reasons, both cultural and medical, that shed light on&nbsp;this unique approach to&nbsp;personal hygiene.</p><p>Culturally, many of&nbsp;these practices are deeply rooted in&nbsp;tradition and local customs. In&nbsp;countries like India, for instance, the use of&nbsp;water instead of&nbsp;toilet paper can be&nbsp;traced back centuries, as&nbsp;it&nbsp;aligns with the principles of&nbsp;cleanliness and purity outlined in&nbsp;ancient texts. Similarly, in&nbsp;Indonesia and the Philippines, the practice of&nbsp;using a&nbsp;dipper and water is&nbsp;not only practical but also culturally significant, reflecting a&nbsp;connection to&nbsp;the environment and a&nbsp;holistic approach to&nbsp;hygiene.</p><p>Moreover, medical considerations play a&nbsp;pivotal role in&nbsp;the preference for water-based hygiene methods. In&nbsp;regions where certain waterborne diseases are more prevalent, such as&nbsp;Southeast Asia, the use of&nbsp;water for cleaning is&nbsp;seen as&nbsp;a&nbsp;safer and more effective way to&nbsp;prevent contamination and maintain personal health. The feeling of&nbsp;cleanliness and freshness that water provides can also be&nbsp;psychologically reassuring, contributing to&nbsp;its popularity.</p><p>Additionally, the invention of&nbsp;advanced toilet technology, like the aforementioned Japanese cleansing seats, has further bolstered the adoption of&nbsp;alternative methods. These innovations not only provide a&nbsp;luxurious and efficient cleansing experience but also align with Japan’s penchant for cutting-edge technology.</p><p>The use of&nbsp;toilet paper in&nbsp;Japan, even in&nbsp;toilets equipped with advanced bidet and washlet functions, reveals interesting cultural and practical aspects of&nbsp;bathroom etiquette in&nbsp;the country.</p><p>In&nbsp;Japan, toilet paper is&nbsp;an&nbsp;essential part of&nbsp;the bathroom experience, and it’s common practice to&nbsp;use it&nbsp;alongside the sophisticated bidet and washlet functions found in&nbsp;many Japanese toilets. These high-tech toilets offer a&nbsp;range of&nbsp;features, including water jets for cleansing, warm air dryers, and even heated seats, making them incredibly efficient and hygienic.</p><p>Despite these advanced features, toilet paper continues to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;preferred choice for many Japanese individuals. It&nbsp;serves several purposes, such as&nbsp;drying after using the bidet or&nbsp;addressing any residual moisture, ensuring a&nbsp;completely comfortable and dry experience.</p><p>However, an&nbsp;essential aspect of&nbsp;toilet paper use in&nbsp;Japan is&nbsp;the proper disposal method. Unlike some countries where toilet paper is&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>routinely flushed</a> down the toilet, in&nbsp;Japan, there’s a&nbsp;distinct protocol. Users are instructed to&nbsp;throw used toilet paper directly into the toilet after use. However, it’s crucial to&nbsp;emphasize that only toilet paper should be&nbsp;disposed of&nbsp;in&nbsp;this manner. Other items, such as&nbsp;feminine hygiene products, tissues, or&nbsp;wet wipes, should be&nbsp;placed in&nbsp;the small trashcan typically provided within the cubicle. This clear distinction helps maintain the functionality of&nbsp;the plumbing system and prevents blockages or&nbsp;overflows.</p><p>The Japanese culture of&nbsp;cleanliness and consideration for others extends to&nbsp;bathroom etiquette as&nbsp;well. Users are encouraged to&nbsp;check the area around the toilet for anything they may have dropped during their visit. This practice not only contributes to&nbsp;a&nbsp;clean and orderly environment but also ensures that nothing obstructs the proper functioning of&nbsp;the toilet.</p><p>Lastly, the reminder to&nbsp;flush the toilet is&nbsp;a&nbsp;common courtesy that ensures the toilet is&nbsp;ready for use by&nbsp;the next person. It’s a&nbsp;simple but important step in&nbsp;maintaining the hygiene and convenience of&nbsp;public or&nbsp;shared restroom facilities.</p><p><h2>1. The plumbing is&nbsp;not made for paper.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bc4/ea3/1f807f5dfdb0c87f5986e8a4f1.jpg><p>The disparities in&nbsp;water management <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>systems</a> between many Asian countries and the Western world are quite pronounced and have notable implications for daily life, particularly when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;the seemingly mundane act of&nbsp;disposing of&nbsp;toilet paper. In&nbsp;these regions, where the infrastructure for waste disposal and sanitation may not be&nbsp;as&nbsp;advanced as&nbsp;in&nbsp;the West, a&nbsp;different approach to&nbsp;personal hygiene and toilet usage has emerged.</p><p>One of&nbsp;the most striking differences lies in&nbsp;the practice of&nbsp;not flushing toilet paper. This may come as&nbsp;a&nbsp;surprise to&nbsp;visitors from Western countries, where it’s customary to&nbsp;flush toilet paper without a&nbsp;second thought. However, in&nbsp;many Asian countries, this practice is&nbsp;discouraged due to&nbsp;concerns over the potential strain it&nbsp;can place on&nbsp;less robust sewage and drainage systems. Flushing toilet paper can lead to&nbsp;clogs and blockages, which can be&nbsp;not only inconvenient but also unhygienic, as&nbsp;these blockages can result in&nbsp;backups and overflows.</p><p>As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, alternative methods have become the norm. People in&nbsp;these regions have embraced a&nbsp;variety of&nbsp;alternatives to&nbsp;toilet paper, such as&nbsp;water bowls, bidets, or&nbsp;bidet showers. These devices provide a&nbsp;more water-efficient and sanitary means of&nbsp;personal hygiene. The use of&nbsp;water not only ensures thorough cleanliness but also aligns with the preference for freshness and cleanliness in&nbsp;many Asian cultures.</p><p>Moreover, visitors to&nbsp;these regions may notice a&nbsp;unique feature in&nbsp;their bathroom facilities&nbsp;— a&nbsp;bin placed conspicuously near the toilet. Contrary to&nbsp;expectations, this bin is&nbsp;not for general waste disposal but rather serves a&nbsp;specific purpose. In&nbsp;many cases, it’s meant to&nbsp;collect used toilet paper. This practice further underscores the caution exercised in&nbsp;preserving the functionality of&nbsp;plumbing systems. Rather than risking blockages by&nbsp;attempting to&nbsp;flush paper, individuals dispose of&nbsp;it&nbsp;in&nbsp;the bin provided.</p><p>Understanding these differences in&nbsp;water management systems and toilet practices sheds light on&nbsp;the importance of&nbsp;cultural sensitivity and adaptability when traveling or&nbsp;living in&nbsp;diverse parts of&nbsp;the world. It&nbsp;also underscores the significance of&nbsp;infrastructure development and how it&nbsp;can impact even the most basic aspects of&nbsp;daily life, from personal hygiene to&nbsp;waste disposal.</p><p><h2>2. It&nbsp;can cause irritation.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ac9/841/2dc4bf5b609e1e5d9620d78e94.jpg><p>The potential for toilet tissue to&nbsp;cause irritation is&nbsp;a&nbsp;common concern that many individuals face, and this issue becomes particularly pronounced when the toilet tissue itself is&nbsp;of&nbsp;a&nbsp;coarse or&nbsp;rigid quality. For those who have certain medical conditions, such as&nbsp;hemorrhoids or&nbsp;fissures, this irritation can be&nbsp;even more pronounced and discomforting.</p><p>Hemorrhoids, for example, are swollen blood vessels located in&nbsp;the rectal area. They can be&nbsp;quite painful and sensitive. When abrasive toilet tissue is&nbsp;used to&nbsp;clean after bowel movements, it&nbsp;can exacerbate the discomfort and even cause bleeding or&nbsp;further inflammation. Similarly, fissures, which are small tears in&nbsp;the lining of&nbsp;the anal canal, can be&nbsp;incredibly painful and prone to&nbsp;irritation. Rough toilet tissue can worsen these tears and hinder the natural healing process.</p><p>Herein lies the wisdom of&nbsp;using water as&nbsp;an&nbsp;alternative. Water, in&nbsp;comparison to&nbsp;toilet tissue, is&nbsp;inherently gentle. When employed for personal hygiene after using the toilet, it&nbsp;offers a&nbsp;soothing and cleansing effect. It&nbsp;can help alleviate the irritation and reduce the pressure in&nbsp;the perianal area, where hemorrhoids and fissures often cause discomfort. The gentle flow of&nbsp;water not only ensures thorough cleanliness but also promotes a&nbsp;sense of&nbsp;relief and comfort that can be&nbsp;particularly beneficial for individuals with these conditions.</p><p>In&nbsp;some cultures and regions, this practice of&nbsp;using water for personal hygiene is&nbsp;deeply ingrained and has been in&nbsp;use for generations precisely because of&nbsp;its soothing and gentle properties. It’s an&nbsp;excellent example of&nbsp;how different cultures have developed unique and effective methods of&nbsp;personal hygiene based on&nbsp;their understanding of&nbsp;human anatomy and well-being.</p><p>The choice between toilet tissue and water for personal hygiene isn’t merely a&nbsp;matter of&nbsp;preference; it&nbsp;can significantly impact an&nbsp;individual’s comfort and health, especially for those dealing with specific medical conditions like hemorrhoids or&nbsp;fissures. By&nbsp;opting for the gentler alternative of&nbsp;water, individuals can reduce the risk of&nbsp;irritation and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>promote</a> a&nbsp;more comfortable and soothing experience in&nbsp;the perianal area.</p><p><h2>3. It&nbsp;may lead to&nbsp;urinary infections.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f9f/4ad/f051a75fc28d236de715838393.jpg><p>Poor wiping habits with toilet paper can <a href=#>lead</a> to&nbsp;the spread of&nbsp;<a href=# title=bacteria data-link=tag>bacteria</a>. Moreover, for women, wiping back to&nbsp;front could increase the risk of&nbsp;transferring bacteria to&nbsp;the urethra. By&nbsp;using alternatives like a&nbsp;bidet or&nbsp;using a&nbsp;wet wipe, it’s possible to&nbsp;escape these issues.</p><p><h2>4. The use of&nbsp;tissue in&nbsp;the toilet has cultural meaning.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5d2/de3/f19fc25f5ab29fabfe11e898cb.jpg><p>The use of&nbsp;tissue, or&nbsp;rather the choice of&nbsp;personal hygiene practices, holds profound cultural significance in&nbsp;many parts of&nbsp;the world. This is&nbsp;particularly evident in&nbsp;the practices of&nbsp;Muslim countries, where the act of&nbsp;washing after defecation carries great cultural and religious importance.</p><p>It&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;fundamental <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>aspect</a> of&nbsp;Islamic toilet etiquette, rooted in&nbsp;the principles of&nbsp;cleanliness and purity.<br>In&nbsp;the Islamic faith, cleanliness is&nbsp;highly valued, and this extends to&nbsp;all aspects of&nbsp;life, including personal hygiene and sanitation. The <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>practice</a> of&nbsp;“istinja” is&nbsp;not merely a&nbsp;matter of&nbsp;hygiene but is&nbsp;deeply intertwined with cultural norms. It&nbsp;reflects the broader Islamic principle of&nbsp;Taharah, which emphasizes the state of&nbsp;physical and spiritual purity. In&nbsp;Islam, maintaining this state of&nbsp;purity is&nbsp;considered essential before engaging in&nbsp;acts of&nbsp;worship. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;seen as&nbsp;a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;maintain physical and spiritual purity before engaging in&nbsp;acts of&nbsp;worship.</p><p>The process of&nbsp;istinja typically involves the use of&nbsp;water, either from a&nbsp;container or&nbsp;a&nbsp;bidet-like apparatus, to&nbsp;cleanse the anal area thoroughly. This ritualistic cleansing is&nbsp;an&nbsp;integral part of&nbsp;the daily routine for Muslims and is&nbsp;regarded as&nbsp;an&nbsp;essential step in&nbsp;preparation for religious rituals.</p><p>Interestingly, a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>similar</a> cultural practice can be&nbsp;observed in&nbsp;India. Despite its diverse religious and cultural landscape, India shares a&nbsp;common thread with Muslim countries in&nbsp;its emphasis on&nbsp;personal hygiene and the use of&nbsp;water for cleansing. In&nbsp;many Indian households, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;customary to&nbsp;use water along with soap or&nbsp;other cleansing agents to&nbsp;ensure thorough cleanliness after using the toilet.</p><p>This practice, often referred to&nbsp;as&nbsp;“<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>lota</a>” or&nbsp;“mug” usage, involves the use of&nbsp;a&nbsp;small container or&nbsp;vessel filled with water for washing. The idea is&nbsp;to&nbsp;achieve a&nbsp;high level of&nbsp;cleanliness and freshness, which is&nbsp;culturally valued and considered essential for physical comfort and overall well-being.</p><p>The cultural significance of&nbsp;these practices extends beyond their religious or&nbsp;practical aspects. They reflect a&nbsp;deep-seated belief in&nbsp;the importance of&nbsp;maintaining both physical and spiritual purity, emphasizing the holistic connection between cleanliness and one’s state of&nbsp;mind and body.</p><p>The use of&nbsp;tissue or&nbsp;water for personal hygiene is&nbsp;not merely a&nbsp;matter of&nbsp;practicality but carries profound cultural and religious meaning in&nbsp;many parts of&nbsp;the world. In&nbsp;Muslim countries and India, these practices underscore the significance of&nbsp;cleanliness in&nbsp;daily life, reflecting the broader cultural values and traditions that shape individuals’ attitudes and behaviors towards hygiene and well-being.</p><p><h2>5. It’s not hygienic enough.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e80/bf9/93b2d955adaa03bca07448f029.jpg><p>The <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>preference</a> for water over toilet tissue as&nbsp;a&nbsp;means of&nbsp;personal hygiene is&nbsp;rooted in&nbsp;the belief that water offers superior cleanliness and hygiene. This preference is&nbsp;not merely a&nbsp;matter of&nbsp;personal choice; it&nbsp;is&nbsp;supported by&nbsp;practical and hygienic considerations that highlight the limitations of&nbsp;toilet tissue.</p><p>One of&nbsp;the primary concerns with using toilet tissue is&nbsp;its effectiveness in&nbsp;removing fecal matter thoroughly. Toilet paper, no&nbsp;matter how soft or&nbsp;high-quality it&nbsp;may&nbsp;be, can only achieve a&nbsp;surface-level cleaning. It&nbsp;often smears fecal matter rather than completely removing&nbsp;it, which can lead to&nbsp;lingering bacteria and unpleasant odors. In&nbsp;contrast, water has the advantage of&nbsp;providing a&nbsp;more comprehensive and thorough cleaning by&nbsp;physically washing away any residue.</p><p>Moreover, wiping with toilet paper alone may not always be&nbsp;sufficient, especially for individuals with specific hygiene needs. It’s not uncommon for people to&nbsp;experience issues such as&nbsp;hemorrhoids, fissures, or&nbsp;irritation in&nbsp;the anal and perianal areas. For these individuals, the friction created by&nbsp;wiping with dry toilet paper can exacerbate discomfort and potentially lead to&nbsp;further irritation or&nbsp;injury. Water, in&nbsp;comparison, offers a&nbsp;gentle and soothing cleansing action that minimizes the risk of&nbsp;aggravating such conditions.</p><p>The perception of&nbsp;water as&nbsp;more hygienic also aligns with cultural and regional practices around the world. In&nbsp;many cultures, particularly in&nbsp;Asian and Middle Eastern countries, the use of&nbsp;water for personal hygiene after using the toilet is&nbsp;deeply ingrained and has historical significance. It’s seen as&nbsp;a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;achieve a&nbsp;higher level of&nbsp;cleanliness and freshness, which is&nbsp;valued both for its practical benefits and its cultural importance.</p><p>In&nbsp;recent years, the adoption of&nbsp;bidets, which provide a&nbsp;controlled stream of&nbsp;water for cleansing, has gained popularity in&nbsp;various parts of&nbsp;the world. This trend underscores the growing recognition of&nbsp;the hygienic advantages of&nbsp;water-based cleansing methods. Bidets offer a&nbsp;convenient and effective way to&nbsp;experience the benefits of&nbsp;water without the need for elaborate plumbing modifications.</p><p><h2>6. It’s not environmentally-friendly.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f7f/bb6/e4e1d652858ef9a0f53f262434.jpg><p>According to&nbsp;expert <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>analysis</a>, in&nbsp;the USA only, 36.5 billion rolls of&nbsp;toilet paper are used every year, representing the pulping of&nbsp;some 15&nbsp;million trees. This also requires huge amounts of&nbsp;water, bleach, <a href=# title=energy data-link=tag>energy</a>, and packaging materials. Using other means like a&nbsp;bidet, as&nbsp;the experts believe, is&nbsp;much more environmentally-friendly.</p><p>The environmental impact of&nbsp;using toilet paper is&nbsp;a&nbsp;topic that warrants a&nbsp;closer examination, as&nbsp;it&nbsp;extends far beyond the simple act of&nbsp;wiping. To&nbsp;understand the broader ecological implications, it’s essential to&nbsp;delve into the statistics and consider the alternatives, such as&nbsp;bidets, that experts often advocate for their environmental friendliness.</p><p>In&nbsp;the United States alone, a&nbsp;staggering 36.5 billion rolls of&nbsp;toilet paper are <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>consumed</a> annually. This astronomical figure represents a&nbsp;significant ecological footprint. The production of&nbsp;toilet paper necessitates the pulping of&nbsp;approximately 15&nbsp;million trees each year. This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;substantial deforestation impact, which not only disrupts ecosystems but also contributes to&nbsp;the reduction of&nbsp;carbon-absorbing forests, exacerbating climate change.</p><p>The use of&nbsp;bleach in&nbsp;the production of&nbsp;toilet paper, while contributing to&nbsp;its desirable white appearance and soft texture, raises significant concerns, particularly for women. Bleach is&nbsp;a&nbsp;potent chemical with the potential to&nbsp;cause health issues when it&nbsp;comes into contact with the skin and, in&nbsp;some cases, can even enter the bloodstream, where it&nbsp;can wreak havoc throughout the body.</p><p>Toilet paper, like many paper products, is&nbsp;bleached to&nbsp;achieve its pristine white color and softness. However, bleach is&nbsp;a&nbsp;toxic substance, and when it&nbsp;comes into contact with the skin, it&nbsp;has the potential to&nbsp;be&nbsp;absorbed. This can be&nbsp;especially concerning for women, as&nbsp;their genital and perianal areas are more susceptible to&nbsp;contact with toilet paper during bathroom use.</p><p>One of&nbsp;the primary issues with bleach exposure is&nbsp;its potential to&nbsp;disrupt the body’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>natural balance</a> of&nbsp;bacteria, which plays a&nbsp;crucial role in&nbsp;maintaining a&nbsp;healthy pH&nbsp;level in&nbsp;sensitive areas. An&nbsp;imbalance in&nbsp;pH&nbsp;levels can create an&nbsp;environment conducive to&nbsp;infection, leading to&nbsp;discomfort and health problems.</p><p>Moreover, the bleaching process used in&nbsp;the production of&nbsp;toilet paper can result in&nbsp;the formation of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>dioxins</a>. Dioxins are highly toxic compounds that can have a&nbsp;range of&nbsp;detrimental effects on&nbsp;the human body. They have been linked to&nbsp;developmental issues, reproductive problems, compromised immune function, and disruptions in&nbsp;the endocrine system, which regulates hormone production and balance. The presence of&nbsp;dioxins in&nbsp;toilet paper, even in&nbsp;trace amounts, poses a&nbsp;significant health concern, especially given the frequent and intimate contact that women have with toilet paper.</p><p>Comparatively, alternatives like bidets offer a&nbsp;more environmentally-friendly solution. Bidets use water to&nbsp;cleanse, eliminating the need for toilet paper altogether in&nbsp;many cases. This reduction in&nbsp;paper consumption directly translates into fewer trees being cut down, less water being used in&nbsp;production, and a&nbsp;decreased demand for energy and bleach. Moreover, bidets do&nbsp;not generate additional packaging waste associated with toilet paper rolls.</p><p>Furthermore, bidets are increasingly designed with water-saving features, such as&nbsp;adjustable pressure and temperature settings, which minimize water usage. Modern bidet technology strives to&nbsp;strike a&nbsp;balance between cleanliness and sustainability, making them an&nbsp;attractive option for those who are environmentally conscious.</p><p>The use of&nbsp;toilet tissue versus alternative methods for personal hygiene presents a&nbsp;multifaceted set of&nbsp;considerations and challenges. From the practical aspects of&nbsp;plumbing systems to&nbsp;the potential for irritation and health risks, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;the cultural significance and environmental impact, it’s clear that the choice between toilet tissue and alternatives is&nbsp;not merely a&nbsp;matter of&nbsp;personal preference. It&nbsp;involves a&nbsp;complex interplay of&nbsp;factors that touch upon hygiene, health, culture, and sustainability.</p><p>The limitations of&nbsp;plumbing systems, especially in&nbsp;many Asian countries, underscore the need for alternative practices such as&nbsp;water-based methods like bidets, which are more compatible with these systems and help mitigate sanitation issues.</p><p>Additionally, the potential for irritation and the risk of&nbsp;urinary infections emphasize the importance of&nbsp;effective and gentle cleaning methods. Water, with its thorough cleansing action, emerges as&nbsp;a&nbsp;viable solution to&nbsp;these concerns, particularly for individuals with specific health considerations.</p><p>Furthermore, the cultural significance of&nbsp;these practices, as&nbsp;seen in&nbsp;Muslim countries and India, illustrates how deeply ingrained hygiene customs can be&nbsp;in&nbsp;society and the role they play in&nbsp;shaping daily routines.</p><p>From a&nbsp;broader perspective, the environmental impact of&nbsp;toilet paper consumption is&nbsp;significant, given the resources required for its production and the waste it&nbsp;generates. This has led experts to&nbsp;advocate for more sustainable alternatives like bidets as&nbsp;a&nbsp;means to&nbsp;reduce the ecological footprint associated with personal hygiene.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSpxYympqysXZbAqq3NrGSdp56peqmt1Z5kraeZobK1ec%2Bap56qXZ67bsDHnqCrZZikuqa%2FjHFnamhpaXw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-most-asians-dont-have-toilet-paper-in-their-homes-801094.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhy-most-asians-dont-have-toilet-paper-in-their-homes-801094.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhy-most-asians-dont-have-toilet-paper-in-their-homes-801094.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhy-most-asians-dont-have-toilet-paper-in-their-homes-801094.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-most-asians-dont-have-toilet-paper-in-their-homes-801094.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-most-asians-dont-have-toilet-paper-in-their-homes-801094.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./1541054-bet9ja-casino-games-odds-winnings-reviews-details.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./1541054-bet9ja-casino-games-odds-winnings-reviews-details.html>Bet9ja casino: games, odds, winnings, reviews, more details</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./toujours-plus-de-sites-pollues-aux-pcb-selon-robin-des-bois.html>Toujours plus de sites pollus aux PCB, selon Robin des Bois</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./toujours-plus-de-sites-pollues-aux-pcb-selon-robin-des-bois.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
