It had hoped to have 45 stores open by 2020 -- with a peak target of 150 countrywide.</p><p>But further openings have now been ruled out as the company struggles to control operational costs and debt.</p><p>Taste last month announced it would "pause the expansion", saying "whilst the Starbucks' store network is profitable (before debt interest and tax), it is not producing the required return on the store investments."</p><p>In its latest financial report, Taste said its food divisions operating costs increased by seven percent in the six months to August, "largely as a result of the operating costs of Starbucks doubling since the comparative period due to the addition of eight stores".</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-9>A tough challenge</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Michael Trehene, market analyst at Vestact, told AFP that the Starbucks name was strong in South Africa but "the current model is simple too expensive to operate."</p><p>It costs an estimated $350,000 to $550,000 to open each new store.</p><p>There is no Starbucks in the country's fashionable tourist hub of Cape Town, despite Taste announcing plans to open there as far back as November 2017.</p><p>"Places like Cape Town are affluent enough to sustain a few stores... (but) the coffee is expensive, which makes it unaffordable for a large part of our population," Trehene added.</p><p>Another market watcher, Casparus Treunicht, an equity analyst at Gryphon asset managers, said Starbucks was a tough challenge to make profitable in South Africa.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"Sure, it is a big brand, but what does it cost to give that product to your consumer?" he said. "You have to import all your ingredients and materials."</p><p>The company sources coffee from nine countries in Africa along with small-batch reserve coffees from around the world.</p><p>"For Starbucks to really make a profit they have to bring the costs down significantly but at the same time you need scale and selling more units,' said Treunicht.</p><p>But cost-cutting is tricky at Starbucks where prime store locations, branded products and fast wi-fi are internationally standardised -- as well as having your name scribbled on your takeaway cup.</p><p>The South African coffee market is also competitive with the likes of Bean There, Father Coffee and many independent outfits targeting middle-class consumers in cities.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>A small cup of Starbucks flat white costs 30 rand ($2), while a similar order at Father coffee costs 22 rand and 26 rand at the Vida e Caffe chain.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-21>Weak economy</h3></p><p>South Africa's middle-class has been under pressure from slow economic growth, while the country is one of the most economically unequal in the world with 27 percent of the population jobless.</p><p>Starbucks, which operates more than 22,000 cafes worldwide, has a presence in only two other African countries -- Egypt and Morocco.</p><p>Taste's entire food division, which includes brands like Domino's Pizza, has failed to make profit since 2015. It had to be refinanced by shareholders last February to the tune of $27 million to pay off its debt.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>It has also secured a $14 million loan from its now majority shareholder, the Riskowitz Value Fund, and may seek fresh refinancing in the near future.</p><p>But Taste is optimistic and says that after securing long-term funding it hopes to reconsider its Starbucks plans. Now they need to convince consumers.</p><p>"I only come here when me and my mom meet once a month, she loves it," said 25-year-old administration clerk Lerato Sedibeng. "I personally can't afford this coffee on my budget."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdku6bD0miuqKqcmXy0wMCrma6bm6h6psTPmqWsoZ%2BjerPBzaxkqK2kYrynedKtnJqlXZ67br%2FAn6mim5FkuKTFw59sow%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fstarbucks-expansion-runs-out-of-steam-in-safrica.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fstarbucks-expansion-runs-out-of-steam-in-safrica.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fstarbucks-expansion-runs-out-of-steam-in-safrica.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fstarbucks-expansion-runs-out-of-steam-in-safrica.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fstarbucks-expansion-runs-out-of-steam-in-safrica.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fstarbucks-expansion-runs-out-of-steam-in-safrica.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./the-last-tree-review-1203116782.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./the-last-tree-review-1203116782.html>Sundance Film Review: The Last Tree</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./ryan-hurst-says-betas-outfit-on-the-walking-dead-has-a-lot-of-nods-they-stole-from.html>Ryan Hurst says Beta's outfit on 'The Walking Dead' has a lot of nods they 'stole from other charact</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./ryan-hurst-says-betas-outfit-on-the-walking-dead-has-a-lot-of-nods-they-stole-from.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
