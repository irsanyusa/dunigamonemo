According to MarketWatch, the international market for gift cards is likely to grow from $318 billion in 2017 to $506 billion in 2025.</p><p>Gift card usage in Nigeria has also increased. A lot of major Global brands have extended their reach to Nigeria which has made the demand for gift cards in Nigeria increase.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>This in turn, also created a market for <a href=# id=1d1570c8-4549-4d41-b25f-ef6d29744d8a>gift card trading apps in Nigeria</a>. Contrary to the situation a couple of years back, where gift card trading probably sounded like a myth to Nigerians in the country, now there are tons of gift card trading platforms that provide the opportunity for Card owners to convert their gift cards to cash.</p><p>Their presence in the market over the years has massively contributed to the place in which Gift card trading in Nigeria is right now. It would not be a stretch to regard both platforms as pioneers. The market has become very profitable. This is because Nigerian card owners finally found platforms to sell their gift cards without being ripped.</p><p>Young entrepreneurs saw the opportunity and decided to go into the market as well, as well all know "Naija no de carry last".</p><p>Their good work has not gone unnoticed. I would be taking out time to extensively talk about both platforms. All their perks and areas could be better as well.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-10>About Cardtonic</h2></p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-7db52471-da70-466c-b335-92ba8243159c data-caption="Cardtonic & Patricia’s Glover App - The 2 gift card giants in Nigeria"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/y0OktkpTURBXy84ZTQwYTJmNTYzZTQ2NjEyZTUwYjJlNTY0OTViZTk2Yi5wbmeRlQLNAgDNASDCww></span><p>Before I get into it, let me tell you a funny but true story behind how Cardtonic was founded.</p><p>Back in 2016, the founders of Cardtonic had a chat with a freelancer from Awka, who just got paid for his services Via Payoneer. He preferred cash to that digital asset at that point. All he needed to do is find an exchange platform that converts digital assets to cash. Which should not be a problem right? Unfortunately, it was. This freelancer said he searched online for weeks for such a platform here in Nigeria and he was unable to get any.</p><p>The owners figured that the freelancer would not be the only one facing this issue. He and many other individuals would be going through the same thing. This prompted their decision to go into the business and make exchange not only possible but easy.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Cardtonic is a modern <a href=# id=3bdd96e9-4fda-46cf-9638-f4be36f2242f>site to sell gift cards</a> that solely focuses on the trading of gift cards. You can sell over 40 gift cards on the platform with just 3 button clicks.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-16>Features of Cardtonic App</h3></p><p><strong>1.

Like I stated before, there was a massive drought in the gift card trading business in Nigeria, converting any digital asset to cash in Nigeria was practically impossible. The few that tried got scammed.</p><p>This issue was what brought about the idea which is Patricia. The founder also attested to the fact that he was also a victim of this digital asset scam.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Patricia decided to decentralize and now;</p><ul class=list><li>All Gift card transactions would be done on Glover instead of Patricia</li><li>You would need a new account number for Glover&nbsp;</li><li>Only Fiat currencies would be used to purchase Gift cards E.g Naira</li></ul><p>Glover is an exchange platform that specializes in the buying and selling of gift cards amongst a couple of other things.
