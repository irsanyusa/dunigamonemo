One day, he took a passenger, who was understandably unnerved by his driving style, and asked him why he went so fast over junctions. The statistics student replied, "Well, statistically speaking, you are far more likely to have an accident at a junction, so I just make sure that I spend less time there."</li><li>A physicist, a biologist, and a mathematician are sitting on a bench across from a house. Two people go into the house, and then three people come out. The physicist says, "The initial measurement was incorrect." The biologist says, "They must have reproduced." The mathematician says, "If exactly one person enters that house, it will be empty."</li><li>The problem with math puns is that calculus jokes are all derivative, trigonometry jokes are too graphic, algebra jokes are usually formulaic, and arithmetic jokes are pretty basic.

The engineer wakes up and smells smoke. He goes out into the hallway and sees a fire, so he fills a trashcan from his room with water and douses the fire. He goes back to bed. Later, the physicist wakes up and smells smoke. He opens his door and sees a fire in the hallway. He walks down the hall to a fire hose and after calculating the flame velocity, distance, water pressure, trajectory, etc., extinguishes the fire with the minimum amount of water and energy needed. Later, the mathematician wakes up and smells smoke. He goes to the hall, sees the fire and then the fire hose.

The interviewing committee asks the mathematician one question: What is 500 plus 500? The mathematician answers "1000" without hesitation, and they send him along. Next they call in the statistician and ask the same question. He thinks for a moment and answers "1000... I'm 95% confident." When the accountant comes in, he is asked the same question: "What is 500 + 500?" He bows and replies, "What would you like it to be?"

The larger the denominator, the smaller the fraction. - Tolstoy</li><li>Mathematics is the door and key to the sciences. - Roger Bacon</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/5db7ef6514234703_w.png><ul><li>The book of nature is written in the language of Mathematics - Galileo</li><li>A Mathematician who is not also something of a poet will never be a complete mathematician - Karl Weierstrass</li><li>Without mathematics, there's nothing you can do. Everything around you is mathematics. Everything around you is numbers. - Shakuntala Devi</li><li>Mathematics is not a careful march down a well-cleared highway, but a journey into a strange wilderness, where the explorers often get lost. Rigour should be a signal to the historian that the maps have been made, and the real explorers have gone elsewhere. - W. S. A</li><li>In a way, mathematics is the only infinite human activity. It is conceivable that humanity could eventually learn everything in physics or biology. But humanity certainly won't ever be able to find out everything in mathematics, because the subject is infinite. Numbers themselves are infinite. That's why mathematics is really my only interest. - Paul Erdős</li><li>Patience is my virtue, but only in Math, Daddy - Ashley ― Ryanne Salve, She's Older Than Me</li><li>The mathematician does not study pure mathematics because it is useful; he studies it because he delights in it and he delights in it because it is beautiful - Georg Cantor</li><li>Mathematics as an expression of the human mind reflects the active will, the contemplative reason, and the desire for aesthetic perfection. Its basic elements are logic and intuition, analysis and construction, generality and individuality. - Richard Courant</li><li>If your wish is to become really a man of science and not merely a petty experimentalist, I should advise you to apply to every branch of natural philosophy, including mathematics. - Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, Frankenstein</li><li>Mathematics is not a contemplative but a creative subject; no one can draw much consolation from it when he has lost the power or the desire to create; and that is apt to happen to a mathematician rather soon. It is a pity, but in that case he does not matter a great deal anyhow, and it would be silly to bother about him. - G.H. Hardy</li><li>Since the mathematicians have invaded the theory of relativity I do not understand it myself any more. - Albert Einstein</li><li>Mathematics are the result of mysterious powers which no one understands, and which the unconscious recognition of beauty must play an important part. Out of an infinity of designs a mathematician chooses one pattern for beauty's sake and pulls it down to earth. - Marston Morse</li><li>Logic issues in tautologies, mathematics in identities, philosophy in definitions; all trivial, but all part of the vital work of clarifying and organising our thought. - Frank Plumpton Ramsey, Foundations of Mathematics and Other Logical Essays</li><li>Mathematics, as much as music or any other art, is one of the means by which we rise to a complete self-consciousness. The significance of mathematics resides precisely in the fact that it is an art; by informing us of the nature of our own minds it informs us of much that depends on our minds. - John William Navin Sullivan</li><li>Mathematics doesn’t care about those beyond the numbers. - Dejan Stojanovic, The Shape</li><li>Mathematics is pure language – the language of science. It is unique among languages in its ability to provide precise expression for every thought or concept that can be formulated in its terms. - A Adler.</li><li>My first feeling was that there was no way to continue. Writing isn't like math;in math, two plus two always equals four no matter what your mood is like. With writing, the way you feel changes everything. - Stephenie Meyer, Midnight Sun</li><li>They shouldn't be allowed to teach math so early in the morning. - Kendare Blake, Anna Dressed in Blood</li><li>Mathematics is the most beautiful and most powerful creation of the human spirit. - Stefan Banach</li><li>One of the most amazing things about mathematics is the people who do math aren't usually interested in application, because mathematics itself is truly a beautiful art form. It's structures and patterns, and that's what we love, and that's what we get off on. - Danica McKellar</li><li>Mathematics is a body of knowledge, but it contains no truths. — Morris Kline</li><li>A term meant to convey a person's inability to make sense of the numbers that run their lives. - Douglas R Hofstadter</li><li>Mathematics effectively began when a few Greek friends got together to talk about numbers and lines and angles. - C.S. Lewis, The Four Loves</li><li>Mathematics expresses values that reflect the cosmos, including orderliness, balance, harmony, logic, and abstract beauty. - Deepak Chopra</li><li>Mathematics is not a deductive science – that’s a cliché. When you try to prove a theorem, you don’t just list the hypotheses, and then start to reason. What you do is trial and error, experimentation, guesswork. - Paul Halmos</li><li>In real life, I assure you, there is no such thing as algebra. - Fran Lebowitz</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/54e5ca4a3def201c.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top funny Chemistry jokes that every chemist should know</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/3a9aca7155a453f8.png><ul><li>Who rebels with mathematics? - Khaled Hosseini, And the Mountains Echoed</li><li>Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty—a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture, without appeal to any part of our weaker nature, without the gorgeous trappings of painting or music, yet sublimely pure, and capable of a stern perfection such as only the greatest art can show. - Bertrand Russell, A History of Western Philosophy</li></ul><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>50 good comebacks to use in any occasion</p><h2>Math pick up lines - math jokes for teachers and other adults</h2><p class=align-left>Do you have eyes for a mathematician?
